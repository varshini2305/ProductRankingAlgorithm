The tempered glass fits perfect. And you can do it all on your own. Just align and voila its done. Incase you placed it wrong, you can slowly peel it and then place it back in the right way again. So I never faced any issue. The only thing I faced is with my back case. Since it's big it keeps pressing on the glass. So the product is great, just make sure your back case isn't an issue.\\n\", '\\n  The glass I have received is of high quality material (worth Rs. 500/- above)It fits perfectly.It adds extra attraction.I am more than satisfied.110 marks out of 100 😃\\n', '\\n  The product is good and fits well. But one issue is that it has a black border, which doesn\\'t align exactly with the screen bezel for M51 and makes the screen a little reduced. The product I receieved had \"for K30\" written on it. Had it been transparent all the way, it\\'d be perfect. Product is good for the price and feel is very smooth. Also it\\'s good for use with a back cover. Packaging was good as always.\\n', \"\\n  The glass is of premium quality and there's no screen loss. In M51 you get the option of increasing touch sensitivity for tempered glass, so touch response is not an issue. I applied it myself and is super easy.

You just need to be extra careful when you're applying it. Just be patience and apply it properly and you never regret.Value for money I must say!!

There is no loss of screen area or anything. Literally the only small thing you can notice by sticking the protector slightly higher is the earphone area at the top of the phone. It wont look like a perfect fit even though the audio is perfectly fine.In conclusion, I already ordered 1 more since the price is so low and not available in local market. Will save me some time trying to search for another incase the inevitable happens. This is easily a solid 5 out of 5 stars for me.\\n', '\\n  This is easily one of the best screen protectors I have ever used . I just followed the instructions and the kit provided and everything went smoothly. There was not a single minor bubble once the adhesive got to work . And its nice to see that the seller has a very proactive approach to customer care although I don’t think you will need to contact them , if you follow the instructions properly .\\n', '\\n  Buy it now.its really cheap but quality is really good.You will not get this kind of thick glass at such minimal price. fits perfectly to the phone.\\n', '\\n  The product is ok. Good in this price delivery time and package was well packed and on time. Long lasting is not certain\\n', \"\\n  It's very good product, one of the best product customer are satisfied for this type of product quality is good\\n\", '\\n  Good looks elegant package was ok delivery was on time should go for it value for money should buy it\\n', '\\n  Good product for buying our smart phone I recommend to buy this product for our phone from Amazon to buy\\n', '\\n  It is very good product and it is also regionable price. Go for it. No one could not give in this price.\\n', '\\n  It sticks very well. Screen controls are extremely fine.

But there is a way to get BP and ECG test on to watch by installing modified versions of Samsung health monitor. So there is a way of getting that to work unofficially.I have bought the 45mm BT version of this watch. This is my experience after using it for 2 days.Price - Reasonable. I purchased with the launch offer at 28k. It is relatively expensive compared to Android Wear watch options, but I think if you have a Samsung Phone, it might be worth it. I have Samsung Note 10 and Samsung works well with Samsung, but I think with the necessary apps installed it'll work the same way on other Android phones.Android Wear vs Tizen: I previously had Fossil Explorist Gen 4 watch which runs on Android Wear. In my personal experience, Android Wear as an operating system needs a lot of work. The Fossil watch was unbearably slow, battery backup was very bad, thought it could do the normal smartwatch things, because of the poor battery, I couldn't use it at all. I just kept the watch on Flight mode and used as a normal watch to display time. My experience here could be biased as I didn't really use Android wear to the fullest. I used it for Navigation a few times, but for that to work, the same Google Maps app has to be open on your phone. It will just tether the content to the watch. On contrary, Tizen doesn't really have Google Maps app or any equivalent navigation alternatives. So it may not be the best for Navigation. Otherwise, the OS basically looks like a modern Smart Watch - with widgets, notification area, quick control panel etc.The watch has an option called Automatic WiFi where it will connect to the WiFi in case it gets disconnected from the phone (Bluetooth). This is super useful. On Samsung phones, there is an option called Call and Text on other devices. If you are signed in with your Samsung account and this option is enabled, even when my phone isn't connected to watch, I can still make and receive calls just using watch while it is connected to WiFi. This is such a great option, just like the LTE version, but on Bluetooth watch using WiFi.Health Features: The watch DOESN'T have ECG enabled in Indian units. They recently got approval in US from FDA but who knows what regulations are there in India and if it will ever come to this. The hardware required is there in the watch, just that Samsung has to get approvals and enable it through Software. Even last year's Galaxy Watch Active 2 is waiting for this. So don't get the hopes high about this. Other than this, it has Blood Oxygen tracking which works, Heart Rate sensor and automatic workout detection. There are a bunch of pre-set workouts in the watch that it can track. And it does a pretty good job. Using Samsung Health app on phone, you can get access to a lot more third party exercise tutorials.Sleep tracking is also available on the watch and it works great. It can precisely track sleep in my opinion and gives out detailed analysis of sleep pattern and efficiency. Once you connect the watch to phone via Bluetooth, all these data gets synced with phone and you can detailed overview on the Samsung Health app on phone.Battery: Battery lasts 2 days if you don't have the always on display. If watch is always on to show time, it takes up a lot more battery. During these 2 days, I used it to track a lot of my exercises, sleep tracking, basic notifications and the battery easily lasted 2 days. But I had the always on disabled. There is a toggle on the watch itself through which you can easily turn this on and off to save battery when required.Miscellaneous: The watch band feels very cheap and light. Though it says leather, the leather band I have with Fossil watch feels a lot premium. This watch band even makes cheap plastic type of noise when you try to wear it. Otherwise, watch is pretty comfortable to wear. Also I prefer the way Fossil looks. This watch looks more like a fitness watch than a regular watch.So to end the review, following are the pros and cons in my opinion:Pros: Great battery backup - almost 2 days, easy to charge using any wireless chargers, has a tonne of features - you can check YouTube videos to know all the features available, works perfectly with Samsung phones, can connect to WiFi in case it is not connected to phone via Bluetooth and you can still make and receive phone calls. This works only with Samsung phones I think, so check about this if this is important.Cons: ECG doesn't work yet, watch band feels very light and cheap, no proper Navigation app, lack of app support because of Tizen OS\\n\", '\\n  Good watch\\n', \"\\n  Its good enough but given the price point, would have liked some more apps. Blood pressure monitoring and ecg not available yet :/Otherwise nice build quality and seems to easy last 2 days with wifi off. I use it mainly for spotify and sleep tracking and notifications so its fine in that regard but for 27K idkEDIT after 3 days usage:If you're buying for spotify, stay away. Spotify app on this thing is a STEAMING PILE OF HOT GARBAGEWhen you link to your phone in remote mode, it takes control and it'll work fine for the first use. After that you're completely and utterly screwed. The app will be stuck. I'm not even talking about the watch app, I'm talking about phone. The now playing will he stuck on one song, no restart will fix it, you can only reinstall the phone app where all your downloaded music goes. Cannot recommend for spotify.Edit 2: after 5 days of usageno blood pressure and ecgraise to wake never works when youre in bedmyfitnesspal app doesnt work with my note 10 plus1 day of battery life with AOD and continuous HR which is reasonable BUT CHARGING TAKES 2 HOURS!!!!!!I am dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars not because of the watch, which is pretty and works well enough but because of the abysmal app support. This isn't supposed to just be a watch it's a smart watch, it fails in that aspect. You can get similar stuff for 7-8K\\n\", '\\n  A lot has been promised in Galaxy 3 in several online reviews by the influencer communities on YouTube but The product does not have what it promises. It promised Oxygen level monitoring, blood pressure measurement and ECG.  None of These features exist.The battery life is of approximately two days. Slightly better than I watch.There are no worthwhile apps in the App Store. Something one will sorely miss if one has seen the app ecosystem of Apple and android. And the apps that exist are clunky.On the whole, a bad purchase that occurred due to the misrepresentations on the internet and YouTube.\\n', \"\\n  Great smartwatch, overall. The 45mm size is just right if you do not wish to compromise on the display screen. The physical bezel is pleasurable to use. The display navigation and touch responsiveness are good. 30 hours on full charge with above average use - so you could push it to 48 hours by disabling some of the features.What could've been better: 1. Speaker output is extremely low to take calls effectively. 2. A silicone strap instead of the firm leather strap provided. 3. Charging takes 2 hours to reach 100%.\\n\", \"\\n  Please  dont buy this watch based on flashy advertisements and youtube videos. I suggest you to go for samsung galaxy watch 4.6 since its cheaper and will work same untill samsung plans on activation of ECG and BP options to watch 3.Battery  didnt last even a day with normal usage ,gps off and always on  display feature off. I'm  not sure if i recieved a faulty  piece or it will improve after new updates. Only o2 sensor is missing  in samsung galaxy watch compared to this as of now ,so if you want to save some cash then old model is still an option.I hope samsung enables ecg and bp feature soon since paying 30k+ for this premium smart watch  and missing  features  makes you loose trust on samsung.\\n\", '\\n  Good product but feels high priced product as this wont serve 100% the purpose of Smart watch. Dosent matter how many watch faces are there you will get bored soon. I mean it will be an option which will make difference sometimes.Lookwise it feels premium.Currently spo2 and heart rate are working which can be measured on 1000 rs devices available in market. Stress management is there but i dint found how to make it automatic. Correct me if any settings need to do.Notification are fine but not fully user-friendly. You can reply some text and whatsapp messages.Battery backup is fine if you limit some unnecessary features. You will get 24 hours battery on standard use.Overall i dint find it amazing but ok product. You can get similar usage/feel on other low cost available smart watches in the market if brand dosent matter to you.\\n', '\\n  The watch was bought with a lot of enthusiasm.... but as all things you want dearly...  this too did disappoint. There is no ECG, BP on the watch yet...God knows when it will come.[The watch active 2 was also supposed to get it and it has been a year now.. ] The biggest shocker was that neither Samsung pay, google pay, paytm or any payment service works on the watch.Also the dial is quite easily scratched if u accidentally bang it. Waiting for the Ringke ring protector.The leather band is ok.... but in India where we perspire so much, I think a steel band would have been better.\\n', \"\\n  Never buy this watch if you are a non galaxy smartphone user. You will surely regret buying this!!!You won't get ECG feature if you have a non galaxy smartphone and there are lot of restrictions if we use a non galaxy smartphone.Samsung has never informed about this. Waste of money. You can get a wear OS smartwatch for much cheaper price.I have bought this watch and now I am regretting. Dear non galaxy smartphone users, DO NOT EVER BUY THIS WATCH.\\n\", \"\\n  \\xa0Looks and build quality -  Really Really amazing.!Comfort - Not 100% comfortable while sleeping but yeah it's manageable.Workouts , Step counter and Sleep tracking - Accurate results no difference at all.Battery - Not much tested but samsung claims battery life for 2 days so probably will test and update here. Out of box battery was 48% by evening 5pm it went down to 32%. So yeah expecting a full 2 days battery on normal usage also it's better to use goodnight mode while sleeping to save some.Customization - Hell lot of customizations you can customise smaller to smaller things to make your experience with this watch much easy and comfortable.Would be much better if samsung would have provided some straps too.\\n\", \"\\n  It's a lovely device - well made, well designed and the rotating bezel draws attention like nothing else. If you have a Samsung phone, then the camera controls are an added bonus. Good battery life as well.Cons - No ECG tracking in India, O2 monitor is iffy and needs a lot of adjustment to work. However, getting a metal strap did alleviate this to an extent.\\n\", '\\n  Moderate size to my wrist , felt 45mm is slight bigger , weight is felt,  vibration is moderate,  leather strap is semi premium , call sound ,and answering is clear and audible  without any distortions. WhatsApp messages are visible,  I could pair with my samsung phone easily with wearable app and with health app. Walking is tracked and notifications can be seen both at phone and watch.  So you wont miss your alerts and calls anymore . Many display dial faces are with app and you can even  modify it custom . Good one,though pricy .\\n', \"\\n  The just released Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 is a beautiful watch and a thumbs up for those who do not own the original watch.  Apart from features like steps, running, heart rate which can be found in other watch products, its ECG, oxygen count and BP measurement stand apart.  It has a very pleasing display and a decent screen.However for those who own the original watch, this is hardly worth the price.  In fact, there are some downgrade levels when compared to its predecessor  which was not expected from such a premium product with such a high price tag.1. Battery:  This is a huge let down.  Just for the sake of making the watch lighter, Samsung has hugely compromised the battery giving a mere 340 MAH instead of the mammoth 472 MAH of the original.  As a result, battery drains pretty quickly and sometimes it hardly lasts 2 days.  Worse, it loses 7 to 8 percent of battery when in sleep mode in the night.  Also, with a depleted battery the AOD mode can never be properly enjoyed.  With AOD the watch may barely last a day and a half.2. Watch Faces:  The watch faces are pretty good but more was expected in this front.  A major disappointment is that in the original watch in AOD mode, all Samsung watch faces (that is those which came pre-installed with the watch) showed seconds even when the screen dimmed that gave it a very premium look which camouflaged the smartwatch tag.  However, in the new version in an attempt to save battery this feature is not available such that in AOD mode no seconds would be displayed that is a let-down.3. Charger:  The original watch's charger was quite impressive.  The basic facility of the charger showing red while charging and turning green when charged was useful.  That is starkly missing in the new version where there is no light indication while the watch is being charged.  Besides, it takes a full 2 1/2 hours to charge!  The original watch took a similar time to charge but the battery was far more powerful than this one and yet the time taken is similar.  That is a huge disappointment.  Samsung could have provided a fast charging facility here so that users do not feel much pinch over the small battery of this watch.4. Sleep Tracker:  The sleep analysis get only displayed in the watch only after you are connected to your phone which was not the case in the original version. Also sometimes the sleep score is too less when you are sure that you did not have all that kind of a bad sleep.  I suspect that going to the bathroom brings down the score drastically.Samsung could have given more options in the watch faces like giving the users the option to choose the colour they want.  Also, in AOD mode why can't the seconds be displayed?  Here, too, if the intention is to save battery, why not give the options to the users instead of forcibly making the seconds disappear?Besides a huge upgrade where the Tizen version is 5.5 compared to 4.0.7 of the original watch, the display is strikingly similar.  Even the graphics are same.Conclusion:  The watch is great for those who do not own the original.  For those who own the original, better to wait for the next version.  Even features like ECG and BP are not available in several countries and if you go by the Watch Active 2 experience a long wait could be awaited in this regard.\\n\", '\\n  Good as expected but did mistake, there is no 4g lte feature in given model.\\n', \"\\n  A good watch in terms of tracking your run and other exercises, sleep tracking also on par. But most of the times when I ride my bike it auto detects as cycling and starts measuring the same. I mean even if I'm riding at about 40km/h. Samsung should look into this and clear this with an update. Battery life on a normal mode is about 2 days +.\\n\", '\\n  The watch looks and feels classy... Heart rate sensor, SpO2 sensor are accurate. I jave compared the readings to professional equipment. The sleep analysis is also very nice and detailed. The jog dial is an absolute joy to use. You can receive calls on the phone and the audio is quite acceptable. The number of warch faces available will keep you happy for a long time. Waiting for the ecg and bp mesurement update. Battery will last aroind one and half days with routine use. With heavy workouts and gps... expect to jave to charge it daily.All in all... a watch that has something for everyone... funky looks for the young at heart... lots of health data for the fitness conscious.. fall detection and ecg (awaited) for the elderly and some convenient features for the productive ones.\\n', '\\n  Intro: I was on a hunt for a good smartwatch, and since Samsung is a pro in the wearables segment, my chase ended on this product.Overall product feedback: The watch3 is a tough competitor to the Apple Watch 6. It looks and feels sturdy, has a good weight to it, the leather strap is premium quality and the rotating bezel makes the overall UX a very pleasing one.Pros:i. The overall product feels high quality and premium, the leather strap adding to the premium feel.ii. The screen is has a great contrast, thanks for it being an OLED panel.iii. The haptic feedback is quite crisp and on point and never feels out of place.iv, The integration between the phone and the watch and tracking your fitness activities is very smooth and needs only one time setup.Cons:i. The leather strap is not a good choice for workouts since the sweat can degrade its quality in the long run.ii. A connectivity hiccup: My watch disconnects from the phone when it moves out of the Bluetooth range, which is expected, but does not automatically reconnect to the phone once it gets back into the range. Maybe there is some setup problem on my side, so it may not occur in your case.iii. Charging speed and Battery Life: The battery life is satisfactory, gave me a good 1.5 days with 25% left. The charging rate is slow, and takes 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.Conclusion: It was a great buy, with the 3300 introductory discount. But even with the full price you will not feel this to be bad expenditure and will love the product.\\n', '\\n  After using this for 3-4 days :Pros:1)Watch feels good and premium, build quality is awesome.2)Better os and features compared to wear os3)Health and fitness tracking is amazing4)pretty good features like heart rate  monitoring, blood oxygen measurement etc..5)Best thing in this smart watch is the precision rotating bezel.Cons:1) felt overpriced2)charging completely is taking approx 2 hr and backup is only 1 and half day approx3) facing some issues connecting with my non samsung android phone4) dont have many apps like in wear os or apple watch5) spotify is not working as expected\\n', \"\\n  This is the best that your android can work with. I use a K20 Pro along with this, which might be the reason why the Wearables App acts up at times and disconnects.But other than that, I've had no issues, being a non-Samsung phone user. It's a brilliant device with hoards of customizable options.Although the Gorilla Glass DX is told to be tough, try getting a screen protector because I had a scratch, after taking extra care of keeping it on smooth surfaces.Blood oxygen level hasn't really worked on my device it, where it fails to complete the cycle which records the data.Let's see what ECG brings.Overall, it's a brilliant piece of art and if you can burn a hole this big in your purses, It's a definite buy!\\n\", '\\n  I got this watch 2 days ago from Amazon, and I must say that I’m really happy with the purchase(for 28k with offer). I’ve paired it with my iPhone and it is working amazingly well, I am able to receive all the notifications and I’m also able to make/receive calls which is great! The UI is really nice and the flexibility to manage everything is top-notch and the main highlight about this watch is its’ looks and the premium feel it gives- A very solid watch with amazing features.

The original Galaxy watch had a much bigger battery and would run for 4 days in a single charge.Overall it's a great smartwatch!\\n\"], 'url': 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=pa_sp_atf_browse_electronics_sr_pg1_1?ie=UTF8&adId=A013504011P32E3L7UH4T&url=%2FSamsung-Galaxy-Bluetooth-Mystic-SM-R840NZSAINS%2Fdp%2FB08FN55MSH%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2_sspa%3Fdchild%3D1%26fst%3Das%253Aoff%26pf_rd_i%3D6308595031%26pf_rd_m%3DA1K21FY43GMZF8%26pf_rd_p%3D2c2b4d9e-f15e-4cf3-8e5c-acf68c668c41%26pf_rd_r%3D80WR7NYVY11014AWK7F7%26pf_rd_s%3Dmerchandised-search-5%26pf_rd_t%3D101%26qid%3D1601263641%26refinements%3Dp_85%253A10440599031%26rnid%3D10440598031%26rps%3D1%26s%3Delectronics%26sr%3D1-2-spons%26psc%3D1&qualifier=1602308551&id=5744699472080636&widgetName=sp_atf_browse', 'category': 'Mobile', 'destination_urls': ['https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A0789677KRMPAXGBRXRR&qualifier=1602308686&id=3427372615333100&widgetName=sp_detail&url=%2Fdp%2FB08J3D1NKS%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB08J3D1NKS%26pd_rd_w%3DhaE7u%26pf_rd_p%3D1801b34c-8af9-42b5-8961-11f124edc99b%26pd_rd_wg%3DWGSuL%26pf_rd_r%3DDQFW2VMGWZRGZBPG3VBJ%26pd_rd_r%3D0559d6a1-b27e-4a50-80f9-391096f7c83c', '/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Active-Bluetooth/dp/B08D85PST7/ref=pd_sbs_147_1/262-5306151-4958149?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B08D85PST7&pd_rd_r=0559d6a1-b27e-4a50-80f9-391096f7c83c&pd_rd_w=BmvjZ&pd_rd_wg=WGSuL&pf_rd_p=00b53f5d-d1f8-4708-89df-2987ccce05ce&pf_rd_r=DQFW2VMGWZRGZBPG3VBJ&psc=1&refRID=DQFW2VMGWZRGZBPG3VBJ', '/Noise-ColorFit-NAV-Resolution-Display/dp/B08D1GV7V2/ref=pd_vtp_147_1/262-5306151-4958149?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B08D1GV7V2&pd_rd_r=0559d6a1-b27e-4a50-80f9-391096f7c83c&pd_rd_w=nq1Cl&pd_rd_wg=WGSuL&pf_rd_p=ea9b07ad-f80c-40aa-b709-c9f95616bd48&pf_rd_r=DQFW2VMGWZRGZBPG3VBJ&psc=1&refRID=DQFW2VMGWZRGZBPG3VBJ', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A0789677KRMPAXGBRXRR&qualifier=1602308685&id=8003650385159525&widgetName=sp_detail2&url=%2Fdp%2FB08J3D1NKS%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1']}, {'_id': {'$oid': '5f815873aaa28c53dfe2b46a'}, 'description': 'Redmi 9A (Sea Blue, 2Gb Ram, 32Gb Storage)', 'price': '₹6,799', 'rating': '4.3 out of 5 stars', 'review_count': '423', 'reviews': ['\\n  Hello. The Redmi 9 A phone I bought is fine. I know Redmi will always be the best. Because I have been a Redmi customer for about 5 1/2 years. My first Redmi phone was the Redmi 2 Prime. But the Redmi 9 A phone I just bought has been opened by the seller. The lamination cover of the box was peeled off. The sealing sticker on both sides of the box was disassembled and then pasted.I did not send this phone back as I do not want to return the Redmi phone and it is difficult to get the phone on flash sale. I would like to sever the Amazon relationship with this. It was a very bad experience for me. good bye Amazon.\\n', \"\\n  If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look\\n\", \"\\n  Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.\\n\", '\\n  Made in china...The country of origin should be mentioned in the description...Returning the Chinese crap\\n', '\\n  Good battery. But phone hangs a.lot. need to restart multiple times\\n', '\\n  Do not go for it...First mobile from Redmi who have lots of issue...I boot my phone and it hang... Touch not working properly...screen is largeSlow working.....\\n', '\\n  Nice phone, looks pretty.good backup of battery Thanks Amazon\\n', '\\n  Made in China product\\n', '\\n  Worst camera ever...both front & back... & Screen resolution is not good.\\n', '\\n  Lovely low budget mobile love u redmi nice look mobile\\n', '\\n  #Good Phone#Battery Good#Display Good# All Good ✔️😍\\n', '\\n  A little bit slow..I think it will more lagged afterwards..Big screen.Camera is not good.. As well as selfie..Ph is For normal users..\\n', '\\n  First, this phone is very good for normal use.It have entry level processor which is good for normal use but i wonder why xiomi not provide any screenguard or back cover with this phone..  most of brand provide the same with their new phone but this phone not have any.Pro-: GOOD BATTERY BACKUP.-: ATTRACTIVE LOOKS WITH HD DISPLAY.-: TILL NOW I DONT FEEL ANY HEATING ISSUE.CONS-: NO GORILLA GLASS( since xiomi not declare is it have gorilla glass or not so may be it is normal glass).-:entry level gaming processor.. may be you feel some issue while playing heavy game.-: many preinstalled app.-: xiomi not provide any protective screenguard or back cover so  it is better you preorder for screen guard and cover..Since it is newly launched phone, i am having difficulty in getting flip cover for this phone in market. AND IT IS THE REASON FOR2 STAR RATING.-: normal 10 watt charger.( I think as the technology changing rapidly, xiaomi must provide upgraded charging option.)-: no type c usb cable.  (It is new launch phone and presently most of phone have this.).-: e compass not working. (Xiaomi says it has e compass sensor but when i try  it shows error)-: a lot hanging issue while playing games.\\n', '\\n  So here is my honest review on this gadget. I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5⭐ for thatPros-•Low price, wont get any other phones in this range• Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.•Good for basic usage.•Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:•camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)•Dont support fast charging. Today almost everyone wants fast charging phones as it is the new need for users now.Overall conclusion:  Go for it  if you are looking for basic use⭐\\n', \"\\n  I got a brand new redmi 9A with too much bad experience. From unboxing its not work properly. Even camera graphics and result very very worst. Also return option not available. You can replace only. So, please don't buy this worst product. Even for first time im facing that amazon support also not supporting in this issue. I've told amazon to return this but they suggest n replied for only replacement.  Very very bad experience for first time in amazon.\\n\", \"\\n  Phone is good and battery backup is very nice,working long time. But one thing i faced that i bought on first sale i found one problem that video recording audio not good very low hearing then i returned that one and get change  with new.

Nothing can replace this mobile in this budget (6799) with such a quality.Now we see  pros and cons with performance.PROS:◾Display - 6.53\" 720 x 1440 pixel is really appreciated in this budget. Even redmi 8a has lesser screen size than this.◾ Battery - 5000mah. Definitely stands for 2 days of normal usage like Facebook, instagram, WhatsApp and web surf. But definitely stands for atleast 1 day in intensive usage.◾ Camera - Even though it has a single rear camera, with 13mp, it manages to give decent pictures and it captures portrait very well( you can see my pictures) Very good optimization with single camera, really appreciable. And lot of features in additional settings which adds some fun. Selfie camera gives decent pic with 5mp. Cannot expect pro quality with this budget.◾ Video quality is really good and upto the mark with 60fps which is usually not available in budget segment phones.◾ No lagging, runs smoothly, no annoying adds still now, and we can uninstall most of the preinstalled apps. So no issues with the apps.◾Speaker is quite decent and sufficient to fill the room. Can not be expected much. It does it\\'s work that\\'s all.◾ Charging - 10W charger is given and it solidly takes 2.5 hrs to get 100% charged. It is quite good.◾ Price - no smartphone with this specs has such low price with good quality.CONS:🔻It is provided with micro usb port. But in this Price segment we can\\'t expect for c port in today\\'s market.🔻No magnetic sensor. But it will be a problem only for frequent travellers to new places if they need navigation directions in maps. But for routine life, it is not that much important.🔻It takes a lot time for initial booting setup. But after that, it runs smoothly.🔻Even though it is claimed as a gaming processor Helio G25, it is not suitable for intensive heavy games. Only we can play a small games which don\\'t require more graphics.Conclusion:✔️At this price segment, those who want a smartphone for normal daily routine works like calling, chatting, online classes video calls, using social media, playing small games, taking decent pictures..you can definitely buy this product. This product is suitable for you and fulfills your day. I suggest you to buy this. You will be satisfied for sure.❌ Heavy gamer who needs a beast processors and pro photographer who needs a powerful camera.. this product is not for you.🔷 Finally, in this price segment, this product does a very good performance. It is worth buying. Worth for every paise you spend on this.Thanks Amazon.\\n', '\\n  Good mobile at this price .I have purchased this mobile for my mom.Best phone for normal usage under ₹ 6800.Best Battery 5000 mah\\n', '\\n  Wast of moneyNot usefull at allNot camera reaulrNot comfortable\\n', '\\n  Better if you buy 3gb version, instead of 2gb ram.\\n', '\\n  Very good quality phone\\n', '\\n  Nice phone at under 7k\\n', '\\n  Best in low price\\n'], 'url': 'https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-9A-2GB-32GB-Storage/dp/B08696XB4B/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&fst=as%3Aoff&pf_rd_i=6308595031&pf_rd_m=A1K21FY43GMZF8&pf_rd_p=2c2b4d9e-f15e-4cf3-8e5c-acf68c668c41&pf_rd_r=80WR7NYVY11014AWK7F7&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_t=101&qid=1601263641&refinements=p_85%3A10440599031&rnid=10440598031&rps=1&s=electronics&sr=1-5', 'category': 'Mobile', 'destination_urls': ['/Samsung-Galaxy-Storage-Additional-Exchange/dp/B089MQ622N/ref=pd_sbs_107_1/258-6174276-2060638?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B089MQ622N&pd_rd_r=e0c387f3-9c8e-4047-9bb6-1ad780154ff7&pd_rd_w=5bbf0&pd_rd_wg=hte7l&pf_rd_p=00b53f5d-d1f8-4708-89df-2987ccce05ce&pf_rd_r=4GV3YD821S0FCCZK88E0&psc=1&refRID=4GV3YD821S0FCCZK88E0', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A01013042196K02NQGVQX&qualifier=1602308972&id=8129434827054159&widgetName=sp_detail&url=%2Fdp%2FB07Z86Q3KN%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB07Z86Q3KN%26pd_rd_w%3D1B5sj%26pf_rd_p%3D1801b34c-8af9-42b5-8961-11f124edc99b%26pd_rd_wg%3Dhte7l%26pf_rd_r%3D4GV3YD821S0FCCZK88E0%26pd_rd_r%3De0c387f3-9c8e-4047-9bb6-1ad780154ff7', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A056651337GH8O4B93YEK&qualifier=1602308972&id=4388231257715744&widgetName=sp_detail2&url=%2Fdp%2FB08F1VSP5W%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1']}, {'_id': {'$oid': '5f815873aaa28c53dfe2b46d'}, 'description': 'OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z in-Ear Bluetooth Earphones with Mic (Black)', 'price': '₹1,999', 'rating': '4.1 out of 5 stars', 'review_count': '28,170', 'reviews': ['\\n  Recieved todayWorth for 2kBut I had one plus wireless bullets 2This one comes no where near that in build quality and premium feeling and sound QualityBut again this product is 4k less.Very light weight to wearBass is good and better that bullets 2.If you have not used bullets 2 then you will be very much satisfied with wireless Z.But anyways I\\'ll use this whole day and if I don\\'t get satisfied then I\\'m going again for bullets wireless 2 onlyEdit:- after 2 days of extensive use and comparing z with wireless 2 I\\'ve come to conclusion that \"Z\" is a steal deal.

Mic problem is that you have to speak louder and have to bring mic towards your mouth to get audible on other side. If you are looking for better quality of sound just go for others. It waste of money to buy these headsets for all including calls, musics and games.\\n', \"\\n  Hello everyone....this is just a quick review about this headsetI use a OnePlus 7pro, here is what I felt about the headset pairing is easy and smooth Volume is not so high (if you are using a OnePlus device coz the volume bar is common for both headset and phone increase the volume of headset phone volume increases and vise versa) if you connect to any other device you get seperate volume for the device and the headset. If you are a bass lover bass is not that punchy but has excellent sound quality ( try listening to Hello by Adele, it just blowed my mind) Battery backup is awsome (Note: 10mins charge for 10hrs works only if you are using the 30W warp charger) Low latency works only in fnatic mode (only in OnePlus device) Magnetic control works for any devicesThat's what I think about the headset. ☺️\\n\", \"\\n  item got today.  too bad mic voice quality. cant hear anything clearly from receiver side. i did'nt expect this from the top brand oneplus , anyways i requested to replaced\\n\", '\\n  Excellent product,After using for 2 hrs still it has 100% of chargeSound is good upto 60% of volume after getting noise.Call clarity both sides superb.Bluetooth coverage distance also superb.Quality is nice.But the problem is made in china, its better to made it in INDIA.\\n', '\\n  Pros: battery backup, connectivity, good looks, easiy fit, light weight, easy to use for entire day.Cons: sound has no bass, mic has to bring near mouth and still voice is not clear on otherside, music quality is poor than even Sennheiser cx 180.Back to wired earphones after few days of disappointment in music and calls.Overall unexpected from one plus.\\n', '\\n  1) no need to worry  about charging (rapid charging & heavy endurance too)2) very good rage... penetrates 2, 6 inch walls .. no disturbance  upto 3 bhk or duplex houses3) good enough sound quality for this price range4)low latency  .. works for pubg and additional  low latency with oneplus fntaic mode5) built quality  excellent6) magnets just works like on_off play_pause7) easy switch between  2 devices hardly takes 5 secs to switchAnd connects to device in just 2 sec as u separate the magnets\\n', \"\\n  I was so excited to use these earphone as the features are attractive in regards to price. Here are my observation and thoughts.Pros :*light weight*Easy pairing (switching between two device is much easy with the help of a button)*Sound quality is Great  but....Bass is decent(don't expect sony XB series, JBL kinda bass ) you can boost bass a bit with the help of equaliser.*Built quality is good. Weight is less.*Battery life is insanely great.Cons :*The 10 min charge 10 hours playback features is available only if u charge this earphone with Oneplus proprietary charger supplied with 1+ phones.* Low latency mode is available in OnePlus phone only.*Bass is good but not great. Dont expect much. Even cheap brand (BOAT,zebronics) 1K  earphone bass is much better from this.*No physical on/off switch. U have to use the magnetic feature to turn this off and on.*Supplied User maannual lacks many details (power input , quick charge features etc*I found this little bit uncomfortable after using for long hours continuously\\n\", \"\\n  I purchased this 1 week ago and got it today. The packaging by OnePlus is superb, better than packing provided by JBL, SkullCandy, etc.Coming to main review-Pros:Sound quality is better than any other wireless headphones in the price range.Build quality is not premium but better than average.The device switching function is great and hassle free.Sound is optimally loud.Battery life and charging time is awesomely fast.Cons:Sound lag while playing games and videos if HD Audio is turned on in Bluetooth Device's Setting. (around  500ms delay)Low latency is just a marketing strategy, you can never feel difference between sound delayswhile fnatic mode on and off.If you are consider using this earphones for playing PUBG or COD an your primary internet is over WiFi, use these only if you have 5ghz band wifi, because bluetooth works over 2.4ghz band that will interfere with your wifi and give you high ping/latency. Also, you will need to turn the HD Audio off in Settings>Bluetooth & Device Connections > Bluetooth > OnePlus WirelessZ to get a least sound lag experience.If they could have provided this earphone with NFC support as well, than this could be a great deal of budget earphones. Now, it is just another pair of bluetooth earphones. When HD Audio is turned on you can literally hear everything in the game, you can tell the opponent position more precisely just by hearing footsteps, but again there will be an audio lag that will be of great loss.\\n\", \"\\n  It collects all the outside noise and is very poor in terms of voice calling. Only good for music. Person on the other hand can't hear you because of the wind noise even from the fan. Worst product. Don't go with the brand name. It's a very poor product. Being a Bluetooth earphone you can't use it while riding your bike or scooter because it catches only wind noise. A earphone's main purpose is to help in hearing, but this is a worst product.

I thought maybe the battery is low, I charged it  for 10-15 mins.Then I opened my amazon app to read the reviews of the product to see whether the Same problem is faced by everyone or just me.To my surprise I found that this item contains extra pair of earplugs and a red cable which was missing from my product .I immidiately placed a return request.1 . There is a reconnecting problem to the device.2. The items are missing from my product.Highly disappointed. Everyone , please give a thought before buying it .\\n', '\\n  Charging cable was duplicate cable.Volume button not working.\\n', '\\n  Low Latency on finatic mode is not anything amazing. It still lag like normal wireless headset. So for serious gaming its not anything great. Even it hurts to say,cheaper boat headset offer much wider sound stage. Fast charging is the only true special feature about it. AAC comes as default codec. May be because I was too hyped about it, the experience was disappointing.. If you just want a normal wireless headset with dash charge + great battery life go with it.. anything other than that is pretty average.\\n', \"\\n  The headphone was not at all the quality that i had expected.

Amazing sound.I already am using the Realme Buds Wireless neckband since their launch and was sceptical about the Bullets Wireless Z.However, during the lockdown, my wife needed a pair of headphones for her conference meetings and was left with no headphones myself.So, as soon as these were launched, I ordered them from Amazon and was not at all disappointed.The mids and highs are crystal clear.The bass is just right.The Realme Buds Wireless sound muffled as compared to the Bullets Wireless Z ,maybe because they are a bit bass heavy.I highly recommend these for those who are looking for value for money headphones.Go for it people.One Plus rocks. As always.\\n', '\\n  Included Components:- Pair Of Bullets Wireless, User Guide, Silicon Earbuds, Safety And Warranty Card, USB Charging CableGive what you say first.....Only wireless bullet z has been given and charging cable has not been given and also pouche which is mentioned in specifications.....Wrost product and no any benefit to purchase this product...Third classs produst seller ane also product\\n', \"\\n  After my 3 months of extensive use i am changing my opinions. My initial verdict was it was a decent pair of earphones for the price. But i am facing many issues now, some of them are unbearable.

Earbuds are not so soft, so it cause discomfort after some time of use.* So if you want to buy an earphones to take calls. Check another option.* If you like bass. Check another option.* If you listen to music for long duration. Check another option.Hope this review was helpful.\\n\", '\\n  The product did not even work for 1 hour. It seems that I had received duplicate product. Unable to turn on the device and the charging was not working properly. Almost after 6hours still it shows red light which means not charged.\\n', '\\n  Would have been a 5 star rating if not for the slightly poor bass. Boat rockerz have better bass at a lower price but the bullets are a better package overall. Warp charging works brilliantly.\\n', '\\n  Just bought this yesterday, and the quality of the headphones is top notch for 1999. You wouldn’t get this much premium for what you pay in any other wireless headphones. The material used is superb and durable. All the features are working just fine. It’s very comfortable. Light as air and won’t hurt your ears even a bit. Buttons are premium and very tactile. Not cheap at all.Coming to the sound clarity, I think these surpass any earphones under 6000 in their quality. The clarity is superb. I don’t understand what ppl are saying that the Bass is low. The bass is superb, clear and thumping enough. If you are looking at bass that will blow your ears out, this is not your pick. All ranges perform superbly for anything from classical to metal.Overall I would recommend this to anyone. It is a great pair. One of the best I have bought over the last 3-4 years. I previously owned Sony, Sennheiser and JBL.\\n', '\\n  Oneplus always keep thier brand value..Great product than i expected.Last 4 years i really happy with oneplus family and this wireless z is great product and unbelievable battery life and value for money. If someone seeking for a bluetooth earphone, go for oneplus bullet wireless z..Good quality and its very easy to use and magnetic control function very nice..Thanks for this product and very good packing superfast delivery even during this situation.. hats off oneplus and Amazon..Cheers\\n', '\\n  Amazon : Timely delivery. Refund processing is very good.Oneplus wireless Z :Pros : Build quality is superb.  Charging is pretty good.  Power backup is awesome.Cons : Sound quality is terrible.  I used for calling and found i can hear everything loud and voice is shrilling  Zero noise cancellation , sound from 50mtrs away from my mic was creating clear noise into call receiver.  For music it is ok ok.  I hardly put it 45mins and got headache. I returned at that moment only.Thanks to Amazon return and refund processed successfully.\\n', '\\n  Do not buy these for PUBG mobile. I repeat do not!!!Sound latency is there, also you cannot turn your mic(of these neckband) on during game the game will only turn your phone mic you have to shout while playing so the mic is good for nothing in gaming.\\n', '\\n  Battery life10/10Music 8/10Ease of use 10/10Was disappointed with the bass quality not that bad thoughGood for long useClose fitOverall 9/10ish\\n', '\\n  Sound quality is not satisfied.

Compared to Bullet wireless 2, this is way more awesome. And that too at 2k. A true winner from OnePlus.Go for it. Balanced music and bass.\\n', '\\n  In love with this headphones 😍\\n', \"\\n  Guys literally I loved this product,At the best price the best quality...The neck band is perfect for everyone the quality of it is really fab...I loved this but I feel that it would be a good sign if I get some more bass effect only for that sake sound quality gets 4/5 ratingValur for money 5/5 for sure...With in fraction of seconds it gets connected after disconnecting...More over the range is fab while taking calls it's crystal clear..I'm using MI A1 and it works perfect, if u have one plus it may work more perfect with the parenting brand.. 😉\\n\", \"\\n  I liked these earphones since before these I was using Jabra Elite 25E but they lack good BT range. While these have really good BT range. Here are listed some good and bad aspects of these earphones.Pros:1. Excellent BT range2. Sound quality is really good. There are many reviews which say it's low on bass but I think I'm okay with it.3. Quick charging and long battery life4. Turn off-on is much faster.5. Multi device connection and pairing with any device is seamless6. Switching between two devices is pretty fastCons :1. It has an LED which blinks after every 4 seconds. You wouldn't notice it in the daylight but it become irritating especially during night. Like imagine you are listening music while sleeping, lights off, and then something starts blinking after every 4-5 seconds. And after a while it start irritating.2. Features like play, pause, next does not work on MacBookI would recommend to cross-verify the features on the official website before buying it.\\n\", '\\n  I got it delivered in 7-8 days due to Covid situation, i was eagerly waiting for it but I was so disappointed when i start using it for first time. No base at all. Seriously you will find no base at all, its like local headphones in terms of base.Light weight, easy to connect, if you are connecting to other headset then u need to use Button to change connection.I believe base is common thing which helps sound to soften and it’s missing here.\\n', \"\\n  OnePlus once again living upto their brand philosophy of delivering an awesome product at a compelling price point. I already own the realme buds and as far as I can compare, the wireless Z is superior in every department that matters to me.Sound quality is the main stand-out feature with good bass, clear mids and controlled highs. This will fit the needs of a lot of people with it's almost neutral sound signature. Fit is good and the large tips work fine for me. What I'm amazed by is the soundstage which is the best I've heard from a single dynamic driver earphone. So far loving it and thoroughly enjoying listening to music and watching videos. For people who might complain about bass, tweak with the eq settings before judging. I'm sure this won't disappoint.\\n\", '\\n  I will consider Sennheiser 275s and JBL endurance run Bt as my benchmark in the review.1. Sound/ vocals are extremely good. It is same as the sennheiser and JBL2. Bass is 10% less when compared to JBL run, but for me bass was not a preference.3. Volume is much loud. You will feel full volume at 50-60% setting.4. For me the wire length is a little bit too long. It will disturb you while exercising.5. Also it does not have the small wire connector, so the 2 wire L & R keeps coming on your face.6. Battery is awesome.7. Auto magnetic pause/play feature is good.8. Type C charging is a need of the hour. So good.9. The range is quite good, because of Bluetooth 5.0If you want a good vocals and decent bass with lots of features then definitely go for it.\\n', '\\n  Pros:1.Good Battery Backup.2.Look is decent.Cons:1.Made in CHINA product.2.SOUND QUALITY IS NOT SO GREAT.(Compared with Honor wired earphone which came with my mobile and Sony earphones and headphones which my family members use) This is additionally tested by my family members also.\\n', \"\\n  Having used the OnePlus Bullets and Oneplus Wireless Bullets 1 have always been satisfied with the quality they maintain in their products. There is a slight latency for gaming however if paired with a oneplus device it seems to reduce drastically, then again that's the issue with most Bluetooth headsets I've used.At 2k these are 1/2 the price of the Oneplus Bullets Wireless 2, though that comes at a marginal compromise on audio quality. Everything apart from this is the same.Excellent battery life of 20hrs claimed however even with heavy use these run for 2 days without a charge. Also the magnetic stick together ear plugs are quite useful in conserving phone as well as the head set battery life. The battery of the oneplus bullets wireless 1 lasted well for over 3yrs with heavy usage.The weight is just about right could have been a little lesser but considering the battery life they have packed it's acceptable. For 200-300 bux cheaper u can get MI Bluetooth headphones however those are heavier on the neck but a good competition.\\n\", \"\\n  Earphone is quite good but i have been hearing rumors that its the best under 2K among all but i will say its 60% and 40% fight between realme buds wireless ... because the build quality is almost same but according to me realme looks quite better and the only draw back is with realme that it has Old model type A port charging and 10 hours of backup ... otherwise the bass of realme is better than oneplus nd i m facing one more problem with it that i have to re-connect my device by clicking the switch button in order to use this earphone for call ... because until nd unless you will not do you'll not able to use it for calls.... nd the only thing i like in the earphone that is the Type C charging\\n\", '\\n  The earphones are very good in sound quality, the sound is crisp and clear and the battery is the biggest feature of the earphones. You can easily use it for 2 to 3 days depending on your daily usage easily without  recharging and even if the battery gets low it charges in under 30 mins fully and then you can use it seamlessly again.The only issue is that the bass is not that loud on the earphones.The other issue I have faced is with the quick switch at time as switching from my phone to the laptop and vice versa sometimes failed and I had to manually connect it.\\n', \"\\n  I have been using this in ear wireless earphone for more than a week and I must tell you that in this price range this one is the best till date. These earphones are ultra light. You can carry this on your neck for the whole day. I'm using this with my One Plus 7T and yes I'm very much impressed with it. No I'm not giving any fake or biased review. I'm just saying what I've felt using it for more than a week. It comes with fast charging ability and yes it really works. They claim the battery backup to be upto 20 hrs and though I've not used it till the battery is dead but one thing that I can say is that you'll definitely get a backup of 15-16 hrs for sure. And coming to the sound quality, yes it's not the best in class when it comes to bass, also it will not disappoint you. These earphones are really loud and fits perfectly in my ear. Thanks to those extra buds. They don't mention anything about noise cancelation but it's the loudness and the way it fits that will make you believe that it has inbuilt noise cancelation. It also has low latency mood for gaming and all but it only works with one plus devices that too in fnatic mood only. That's the only thing that I didn't like. And yes about connectivity, it is very easy to connect. It doesn't have a on/off button and hence all these are happening though that magnetic locking. Once you detached them, with in seconds, it will get connected and if you attached them together then it just shut down. The connectivity range is also pretty decent,in fact more than sufficient. And call quality is flawless. If you're looking for something that comes with some good features,have great sounds and if you're a fan of fast charging then you should definitely go for it. It's really worth the price you pay.PS: I'm using 7T hence performance might very with another device. So do check other reviews before buying.\\n\", '\\n  Not for phone calls. When the earphones stick to each other, the headset powers off and disconnects from phone. When the phone rings for incoming call, to answer it on headset, one must first separate the earphones. Then the headset powers on and starts to connect to your phone. All this while your phone keeps ringing. When you start hearing the ring in your earphone and press button to answer the call, the call disconnects. And now you must return the call. If you want to use for taking calls, you will have to ensure that one earphone is always in your ear or fix right earphone somewhere away from left earphone so that they cannot come close, if left hanging, or else they will stick to eachother and power off the headset. Switching between 2 devices is good feature. I have it paired with my OnePlus 7t and my Ipad Pro and just by the button twice, I am able to switch between watching a movie to answering a phone call and back to watching movie on IPad. But the earphones should not disconnect from phone and they are joined magnetically. My main use is for taking calls and I hate a earphone permanently inserted in my ear canal like an earpod or other bluetooth single ear earphone. I had Samsung level U for many years and it also this feature of earphones sticking to each other magnetically but the headset does not disconnect from phone. And since these cannot be returned, I just made a loss of 2000 Rupees :-(\\n', \"\\n  I bought black variant from most trusted Amazon seller Appario Retail on 24th May.Delivery was perfect and was done well before the promised delivery date even in this lockdown scenario.Product was in new and original condition, and sealing was proper and untampered.I use these with my OnePlus 7T android phone and Windows 10 Lenovo laptop.I mainly use these for music listening, Netflix & Amazon Prime on my PC, Office meetings on Microsoft Teams platform, and college classes on Google Meet platform.This is my first wireless neckband. Previously, I have used Sennheiser CX 275 S, Philips SHE1405WT and other wired earphones.I love this product. I am perfectly happy with this product and haven't encountered any issues so far.In detail -Pros1. Perfect build quality and very functional, lightweight and comfortable design2. Neckband rests perfectly on my shoulder around my neck and doesn't fall off. Well balanced and comfortable3. Default earbuds fit perfectly in my ears, are comfortable and don't fall-off (big plus for me)4. No issues in audio quality department. I have seen people complaining about this having not enough bass, but I haven't felt anything lacking in its sound. It's pretty satisfactory as per my taste. So, thumbs up for sound quality. Just to add, I haven't used any of the Sony's Xtra bass earphones so I cannot compare with them.5. Quick charging and long battery life6. Type-C charging so my OnePlus 7T charger is more than compatible with this neckband as well. No need to maintain or carry multiple cords or chargers7. Ease of connection is amazing. Just detach the earbuds and you are connected in less than a sec to your last connected device. Voila.8. Quick switching works flawlessly and is really quick too (within ~1 sec). I switch almost 20-30 times between my phone and laptop in a day and it works like a breeze every time. I am really impressed with such ease of switching. These buds have surpassed my expectations in this department9. Perfectly compatible with Windows 10, and Microsoft Teams and Google Meet platforms on laptop. Haven't had any issues taking my meetings or classes so far. It works flawlessly, no audio breaking, stuttering or dropped connections. Connection is robust and reliable. Audio quality is also loud, clear and good. This neckband is as good and trustworthy in this department as you would expect from any other good wired earphones. Any issues in this department would have been a real deal breaker for me. So I am kinda relieved and also impressed with its perfect performance10. Mic quality is good too. Haven't had any issues making myself hear using this neckband. No complaints from me or the person I am talking to so farConsNone so farI don't play mobile games so no comments on lag or anything from my side.I have been using it (heavily) only for one and a half weeks now, so no comments on its durability.Overall, this is perfect product. Robust and perfect in every department. Flawless. No complaints so far. Great product from OnePlus. I really love my first neckband and I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect product in every department. A big thumbs up to this product and OnePlus. Go for it without thinking twice.\\n\", '\\n  Returned the product on 2nd day.Cons: My foremost reason behind is that I found this in-ear headphones quite uncomfortable for me; causes pain after 40-50 minutes of use. Secondly, the bass is absolutely negligible. I tried to fiddle with equillizer but unfortunately, these are pretty weak on bass.Pros: I use OnePlus 7 & pairing with my mobile is buttery smooth. Build quality is very good. Apart from bass, sound quality is simply impressive; very crisp highs & mids. Charge it once & forget about the battery. Used them for +7 hours & the battery was still 80% left.\\n', \"\\n  HUGELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!Earphones stopped working on the second day. Light is not switching on even after one hour of charging. and also like most of the customers, there is no never settle printed inside the box. Geniune one has the label printed inside the box. Amazon please look into this n don't allow fake products.\\n\", \"\\n  Exceeded my expectations.Music quality is very good and also has great bassBest earphones in this budget and it also doesn't feel like a budget earphones.Thanks to Amazon for super fast delivery.\\n\", '\\n  Omg! These earphones are dope. You really need to get these if you want a good quality earphones under 6k. I was using the samsung u-flex earphones before these but they hurt my ears so much so i thought of getting these. These works so well with my oneplus and the battery is the best part,it lasts so long. I think i charge them once in 3-4 days. I just loved these. ❤️❤️\\n', '\\n  Worst service provided.Received dead product , No power up and no response even after connecting with charger.Not expected from OnePlus.\\n', \"\\n  Lets start review with prosPros:1. Build quality is top notch.2. Pairing is relatively easy.3. Warp charging WITHOUT ONEPLUS CHARGER is awesome 10 min charge 10 hours battery !!4. Magnetic control is good to pause music.Now coming to consCons:1.The blinking light is really disturbing in dark. It blinks even after pairing with phone. OnePlus I don't need you telling me every 10 seconds that my earphones are paired 🤦\\u200d♂️2. LOW LATENCY MODE doesn't work on other phones except OnePlus 5 and above !!!!!3. Finaly I would say this little gadget is awesome if you have a OnePlus device but it's not well suited for you if your phone doesn't have Bluetooth 5.0 sadly mine is 4.2 !! My advice would be dont get fooled by stars on the product page because the stars are given literally by OnePlus fans and not honest reviewers who aren't biased in their opinion !\\n\", '\\n  Top notch headphone, the 🏆 WINNERYes, yes, yes, it is value for money, it has great sound quality and its battery back up is amazing.***** Sound Quality *****First thing first,  great sound quality. I am not a sound engineer but I listen a lot - calls and music. I\\'ve used airpods, AKG wired ones, Galaxy buds and I find nothing lacking here for this gem.Let also bring the cat out of the bag : bass 🔊 qualityMany disappointing reviews and comments related to bass. So let me tell you this, most of are bass heads and like all of you I was disappointed when I heard it at first. Why is that ? Because OP bullet Wireless Z (that\\'s a mouthfull) has been tuned in for balanced sound and hence you can hear crystal clear music which is bass neutral.So what do you do if you want that THUMP?simple you customize it and it works. I used S10e and on this phones equalizer presets I have chosen \"Jazz preset\" and it gives me amazing bass (refer to the first image). If you are on a different phone, use the image to tune frequencies for that thumping bass.***** Overall Functionality *****Battery life 🔋: just amazing, see the images, showing battery percentage, it has lasted me 2 days, while 2nd days with very heavy usage.Charging : I use my Samsung 15Watt charger and it charges pretty quickly, perhaps 1.30 hrs or less.Connection : connects and pairs quickly, shows battery level also when you go to Bluetooth settings.Device switch : this works like a charm, I have connected it to my laptop and my mobile, and it switches literally with just one push of a button.Those who do not want to carry a small charging case (read TWS like airpods and buds of the world) , because we keep misplacing it. Then just hang it around your neck like a friendly snake and you are super-powered now.Must have bluetooth headset. I love it.\\n', '\\n  Hello guys,Tbis is my review after usage for 2 weeks, before ordering this i am using realme buds air and infinity, i am pretty much happy with this purchase, reason is mammoth battery afyer moderate usage it will give me approx 2 days of usage. What a battery life this thing have wooow. Definitely i will use this for my travel as it wont die till my destination. I attend a lot of calls and this thing is a pro, helping a lot with this type of battery. Will rate 4.5 stars out of 5 cheers.Pros :1.Battery  ( 2 days moderate usage)2.Good microphone.3.Build quality and light weight.4.Easy to carry5. Seriously Good sound quality  ( No punchy  bass but enough for me found no difference  between infinity and boat 225, just bit less  than realme)6.Connectivity switch for multiple devices(i use  two phones and switching is so easy.7. 2 seconds connectivity.8. UsB type c.Cons:1. No punchy bass.\\n', '\\n  OnePlus Wireless Z is the budget option to the Wireless 2. Where you save the 1000 INR is the plastic body, No carry case, and Missing AptX support. What you still get? Quite a lot, seamless OnePlus device ID paring, Dual-device paring, and Bluetooth 5.0 energy savings.For most this is a good trade-off. Drivers are well mounted with minimized turbulence. Little bassy (likely market demand).This review would be updated after 48hrs of use.\\n', \"\\n  Writing this after 2 weeks of use.Sound quality fine. Not so great but still good.Charging time really good with OnePlus charger. But battery, not so good. 20 hrs as they say, I'll say it's barely half of it (based on actual usage).I'm facing really insane connectivity issues. It gets disconnected after 20-30 seconds and then gets connected again in 10 seconds. It's really irritating during calls. And I guess it happens when battery is low. But still shows 60%. My return windows is closed 2 days back. I ignored the issue when it started 7-8 days after purchase, and now I'm stuck with this.I'm not writing this review to get replacement, but if you face any such issues get it replaced within 10 days.Thanks.\\n\", \"\\n  Amazon was timely with their delivery, no snags, was delivered early.Im currently using a OnePlus 5.First impressions were great. But after a few days the left earpiece started to show signs of degredation. There seemed to be a slight muddiness in the sound. The left ear also could not isolate sounds as well as the right ear and so it was uncomfortable to use - I had to adjust by pressing the earpiece farther into my ear canal.Other things :1. The battery backup is amazing. Due to Lockdown, I've been using these headphones for atleast 8hours a day, and yes, the advertised 20hrs seems to be correct. Also the charging speed is honestly amazing - again, the advertised 10min does equate to 10hrs of listening. The device charged to 100% in half an hour.2. Bass was adequate for me, I'm not an audiophile or a basshead.3. The device is light weight, and does not irritate the skin in any way.I had high hopes for this OnePlus release, but they let me down. I'm gonna return this and buy another pair of headphones.\\n\", \"\\n  Received the product before date, but did not received the cashback yet. Hopefully i will get it soon as Amazon never did it before.Talking about the product, after 4 days of use the charge is still there. Everyday i used it for more then 5hours still 20% left.About the sound quality its awsome with my oneplus7t, bass is little low  but we have equalizer settings on 7t which controls the sound quality according to your taste.Wires are quite good, i won't say its bad, but could have been better.Overall i can say its a great earphone if you have oneplus phone. It works really great.Just go for it..\\n\", \"\\n  Superb bluetooth earphones from One Plus brand. These earphones have superb bluetooth connectivity. Easily paired with my mobile. Have a good range of about 10 meters. The sound quality is excellent on both the sides. The switch over mode in this product is the best part of all. It can switch between two device very fast. Quality of the product is superb. Feels premium. It is water resistant. Volume up down, call receive / play buttons functions perfect. Sound quality is good on both (caller and receiver) side. The noise cancellation do actually works perfect. At last I would say excellent quality bluetooth earphones under 2000 bucks. Don't think much just buy them straight away.\\n\", \"\\n  Here i am writing my first impressions after juat uaing this for an hour.Sound quality is clear and crispy, but at peak i dosnt like it .sweet just below the peak level.For battery no complaints at all.Charging rock's.Light weightGood built quality as per price tagJust lag a point behind realme buds in matter of sound with just a bit...Over alll a decent package. Beat suits with oneplus device. As for me...\\n\", \"\\n  1.Build quality:all plastic and rubber but feels premium and very lightweight, after sometime u will forget that something is in your neck, wire is thick enough and will not break. The only thing i wished to get is the oneplus logo in a different color, it is in the same color of the earphone and doesn't stands out.2.Sound quality:awesome surrounding sound, bass is adequate but not overpowering the mids and lows, treble is sharpVocals are clear, full volume is loud enoughLove its sound profile, very balancedEveryone should love it.3. Battery backup: The main highlighting feature of this earphone, yes it has a great battery backup, company claims 20 hours on full charge, yes it provides at least 18-19 hours at 70-75% volume, i didn't had to charge it for 4-5 days on continuous usage. And u can fast charge it with any charger of rating 5V-600ma or higher. 10 min charge will really give u 10 hours of battery backup,awesome.4.Other features:The magnetic controls works awesome,just as u detach the buds, within 2-3 secs the buds gets connected to the last paired device, join them together to turn it off, works very quick and flawlessly on every Android device.The in line microphone is surprisingly very very clear and the person hearing u will not face any issue,if the mic is at a distance from u also it catches your voice, very good micButtons on the mic are tactile and provides a multifunctional key and volume up down buttons, buttons are very responsive.The quick switch helps to connect from one device to another previously paired device within 3-4 secs by just double tapping it, awesome.Overall very feature rich earphone with a great battery backup and sound profile,go for it,it is the best value for money,Additionally,U also have the brand Weight of Oneplus 💯\\n\", \"\\n  I just don't know how people are claiming that they are not good in terms of bass...just turn on ur device's equalizer guys ... they are way wayy better than realme buds air ... i have bothThe Soundstage is better on oneplus  i mean in every aspect z  sound better either it is treble, mids , bass or Soundstage ...the product is superb but have a doubt that the box inside doesn't have a never settle tagline  but overall it is superb.\\n\", \"\\n  I have OnePlus 7t..The sound quality is so freaking amazing with my OnePlus 7t(with OnePlus equiliser)...OnePlus nailed it in every department...Battery quality is amazing  (u don't have to use warp charge you can use any 2A charger)....Build quality is so amazing...I've used in some other devices like macbook pro 2018, honor play, OnePlus 3 belive me the sound quality is amazing...I've so much experience about earphones...I've used most of the popular earphones (SENNHEISER CX180, JBL C100SI, JBL C100TWS, SONY EX155, SONY MDR-XB55AP, REALME EARBUDS 2, BOAT BASSHEADS 225, MI DUAL DRIVER, MI BASIC EARPHONES and many others) and the OnePlus's sound quality is the best...If you want much more bass as i want just use equiliser, I'll share the photo of my equiliser setting in my OnePlus 7t with this review...If you have OnePlus smartphone just go for it...\\n\", \"\\n  I used it for exactly 15 days before writing this review.Design: It's good looking and nice colours are available. Mine is black and it's awesome.Comfort- You won't feel like wearing it. It's so light in weight. You can use it while exercising or while jogging but don't forget to choose the right ear tips.Built Quality- It's not a cheap material. It feels like premium. And it's highly flexible. You can fold it and keep it in your pockets.Microphone Quality- It's awesome. The person will clearly hear you. No issues with that.Sound- Yes! It has less bass. I was using Mi basic earphones before and I feel the bass is less even when compared to that. It's less but it's there. The other sounds like Vocals, mid's and highs are super cool. You will like the sound output. It's very balanced.Connection and Quick Switch- It's super fast. I haven't faced connection issues in my 15 days usage. Quick switch is one of the best feature and works well.Battery- I used it at 70% volume and it lasted for 16-17 hours. It might last for 20 hours when audio output is less than 60%. And I monitored it twice while charging. It took exactly 50 mins from 0-100. I used a 5V 2A charger. And once using fast charger it took around 30 mins to get fully charged.I would say it's a must buy if you want a balanced sound and premium earphones.If looking only for heavy bass then a big NO!\\n\", \"\\n  These headsets are not good at all for comfort. You can not use them for long because of there big and hard ear tips. Your ears will get paining. They are not even produce sound like 500 rs earphones. Just lound sound. I don't know how people are saying in their reviews that it has less sound production. Oneplus just gave good packaging to impress people but reality is different. In my opinion please dont buy these. I waste my money hope you will not.\\n\", \"\\n  OnePlus definitely stands out in innovating its products and the Bullet Wireless Z is no less exception, one cannot probably get anything better in this budget.The sound quality is GOOD if not awesome (one cannot complain comparing them much expensive earphones), the bass, treble are well balanced and the earphone design perfectly suits at least in my ears. I have used them continuously for over 4 hours and didn't felt any pain or much discomfort, only issues I faced is the cold felt as the earphones are made of some metal.The rubbery back is much better than many wireless earphones which just provide a wire, these are flexible still holds well on the neck, even one can use them lying on the bed and they will still grip well on the neck with no pressure compared to plastic ones, the wire ones on the other hand tends to slip.The best part about these wireless earphones is its battery, it just last longer and charges up very fast even with normal chargers, there is no need to use the OnePlus Warp charger and the company recommends a normal 2A charger which will charge it fully in around 40-45 mins and lasts around 20 hours of usage.The small USB to type C cable provided can also be used for data transfer, the size is good to carry around and use in both phone and the earphones.Lastly it syncs really well with OnePlus phones, connects to Bluetooth really fast and supports Dolby Atmos, one can enable it in Settings > Sound & Vibration > Dolby Atmos and experience a better music and game playback,Magnets on the earphones are really powerful and provides the on/off feature which is really very handy\\n\", \"\\n  Hii guysWell talking about the package I got the delivery before time in this C-19 times also  So the packaging is good as a product of One Plus with some extra buds, A RED Cable,paper work and the main earphones  The design is quite flexible and buds are also comfortable in ear for long usage.however plastic doesn't feel that premium, but its good for 2000 INR  Talking about the features this product is FULL of Features such as magnetic on/off quick switch ,10 min =10 hrs ,l.

They do not call the customer or anything, they just wait for the customer to come to the office for enquiry and then they'll handle the product to the customer. Saving their energy perhaps.\\n\", '\\n  Ok Lemme get this straight through. These pair of earphones is not ideal for listening to music. All these earphones are aimed at is for making you life a lil easier and a lot easier if you have a OnePlus device like me( OnePlus 7 pro in my case). Lemme tell you how1) Awesome battery life. I got it at full charge when I unboxed it it\\'s the third day of my use haven\\'t charged it yet and am still hovering around 30%. I\\'m pretty sure I used it over 5hrs the past two days and in and around 3 hrs now and it still had 30% charge left. So their claim of 20hrs is kinda true as I fell if I go hard on it today even then I\\'ll get atleast 5hrs more of battery life that would make it in the territory of around 18-19 hrs. Good job OnePlus2)Easy pairing with a OnePlus device as it shows a headsup when you turn on bluetooth of your phone and wake the neckband up with the push of a button on the nack band. As for other devices you have to connect it the old fashioned way and once connected it would connect almost instantly the second time. Thubs up again3) Water, dust and sweat resistant. If you are like me you you swaet a lot don\\'t wory cuz these can take those sweaty time no problem4)Very light weight to wear and you will no find it uncomfortable but after a few hours you would still find it a lil taxing on your ears like any earphones do but still it\\'s better than most other I\\'ve tried4)If you have other devices like me then you will love the quick switch it\\'s really handyNow let me tell you who this earphones are not for1) If you wanna play mobile games on any other phone other than OnePlus DONT BUY THIS. CUZ IVE NOTICED SOME LAG IN THE IN GAME SOUNDS, EVEN IF IT\\'S NOT THAT HIGH THAT YOU CANT PLAY ITS STILL THERE AND YOU WILL NOTICE IT. PEOPLE MIGHT SAY YOU WILL GET USED TO IN TIME, YOU MAY BUT I DIDN\\'T. ALWAYS GO FOR A WIRED EARPHONES FOR THAT.Well if you have OnePlus device it comes with this fnatic gaming mode so the latancy us remarkably low and very much playable. But that\\'s an exclusive feature so yea.2)If you love listening to music and you need those rich base and lovely vocals and clear mids and highs never buy ANY BLUETOOTH EARPHONES IN THIS PRICE RANGE, ALL OF THEM SOUND GARBAGE COMPARED TO WIRED COUNTERPARTS WITH SAME PRICE. THIS DOESN\\'T MEAN THE OP BULLETS Z IS BAD BUT IT WAS UNDERWHELMING FOR ME AS I HAVE BEEN USING THE \"Sony MDR XB75AP\" for the past 2 years and I haven\\'t yet found anything that sounds better than those in this price bracket for a long time.SO IF YOU ARE LIKE ME WHO HAS A DECENT PAIR OF WIRED EARPHONES THAT GIVE YOU GREAT SOUND QUALITY BUT WANT THE CONVINCE OF A WIRELESS SOLUTION GO FOR IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTEDPS: THE SOUND OF THESE GOT BETTER OVER THE 3 DAYS IVE BEEN USING IT, I DON\\'T KNOW IF ME ADJUSTING TO IT OR IF IT IS THE BURN IN OF EARPHONE THAT OCCURRED IT SOUNDS MUCH BETTER NOW AND YOU WILL BE BETTER OF LISTENING TO MELODIES AND MUSIC WITH BASS JUST ENOUGH TO GIVE THE MUSIC A DEPTH TO THE SONG CUZ FOR THOSE THESE ARE GREAT AND VOCALS AND HIGHS ARE PRETTY WELL BALANCED. YOU DO GET ENOUGH BASE FOR THE SONG BUT NO OVERPOWERING IF YOU ARE INTO THAT THEN GO FOR IT .BUT IF YOU WANNA SPEND THE MONEY TO GET AN EARPHONE THAT SOUNDS BETTER AND DON\\'T WANT THE FANCY WIRELESS LIFE THEN GO BUY \"SONY MDR XB-55AP, it\\'s of the same price but way better quality of sound.If you are reading this last line km pretty sure you are serious about spending your money so I\\'ll give you one last tip\"If you don\\'t have a wired earphone that sounds good then don\\'t spend your money on any wireless earphones in this price bracket you will not be satisfied. Just buy \"Sony MDR-XB55AP @ ₹2000\"Or save up some money and get it\\'s big brother \"SONY MDR-XB75AP @ ₹3000.

Superb feature to quick switch i use it to game on my legion y740 no lag while paying Apex legends, Valorant and many more games it did a great job no sound lag.. Bass is just fine i don't know why people complaining, however bass can be easily tuned if u need more thump.. I would say these earphones wouldn't dissappoint anyone. I found the joints and the wire quality overall quite thick and well built... Noise cancellation good too along with the quality of sound... Ask me this is the best wireless earphones for 2k hands down.... Kudos OnePlus (devices used OnePlus 7t & Legion y740)\\n\", \"\\n  I just started using these today.Good build quality, especially like the rubbery neck band.Loving the device switching feature, to switch between phone and laptop with a button click, in wfh.Good sound quality, and mic quality.Will write update about battery life(which I am hoping to be awesome) and music later.Update :Battery life is awesome. It's in the range of 15-18 hours. Roughly double the other options available in the market.Music is also to my liking, can hear minute instrumens and recognize the direction of the sounds as well.Really great product.\\n\", '\\n  I don’t know much about this stuff And I rely largely on customer reviews to be able make up my mind. And I am so glad I bought this.It’s been a week now and I can shareColor - bluePrice - reasonableTalk time- about 14 hours atleast on one full chargeMaterial - made of silicon type of material but super light weight - you can’t feel it at all and sits well around the neck and doesn’t slip around.EarPods - snug fit and great sound quality.Range - about 8 MetersI spend 10-12 hours on video calls daily. For me This is a good purchase and Value for my money!\\n', '\\n  First things first... It\\'s ONEPLUS.... The Premium one...At first I was very confused of buying this item because of the reviews said that it was low at \"Bass\". I ordered Realme wireless earbuds...  Then my inner feeling for OnePlus draw me back towards this earphones and I cancelled the Realme wireless earbuds order...Checked the reviews again for 2 days in Youtube by tech experts... Found Interesting about this Earphones... Let me give you a brief explanation about the pros and the cons of this Beast...PROS:1) The build quality is excellent as it is rubberized texture and easy to bend and keep in pocket2) The quick charge is an awesome feature where OnePlus claims the hashtag #10 mins charge and use for 10 hours and this is absolutely True....3) Battery life is awesome in this when compared to other earphones at this price range4) The quick switch feature allows me to switch between my Laptop and my Mobile which is a very interesting feature and so easy5) Main thing the sound.... The Treble, Vocals and Mids are perfect and you can hear every sound crystal clear while listening to song or playing games.. BUT when comes to Bass... The bass exists but not that kind of base where our indians prefer to be like DHOOM DHOOM lol6) The Low latency works perfectly in my OnePlus device in Fnatic Mode and gives a different kind of experienceThese are the Pros... Now let\\'s talk about Cons which are ultimately very less....CONS:1) The Voice quality is good but sometimes I do feel a disturbance from the other parties...2) The Bass needs to be improved as I said our Indians need much more bass.. but according to my opinion they were good to me...These are my opinion on the OnePlus bullet wireless z.... Hope you all find this review helpful 👍😁\\n', \"\\n  Dear Friends...Please don't confuse with so many reviews..I do not write reviews on Amazon even I am prime member for last 5 years.I purchased it yesterday and thanks amazon you delivered it 6 days before the promised date..I love amazon for the fast delivery..

All the previous ones failed due to bad sound or low battery backup. These headphones are just bliss in both categories. I used to love bass heavy earphones but over time, I've started realizing the importance of balance in the sound and the stage created by any earphones. If you are looking for bass-heavy earplugs, use a size bigger silicon tip to create extra seal in your ears, that would allow you to enjoy the bass in any earphones. But no sealing can provide the right balance and sound-stage in headphones until 2700rs.I wanted to try the Oppo enco M31, as it costed the same as these pair. but the fragility of that device brought me closer to Bullets Z. Although Amazon offers a 10 day replacement policy, I never thought of returning this pair.When these arrived, they had some charge still in them. So used it till it disconnected and then charged for exactly 10 minutes. Voila, they lasted me close to 2 days. Thereafter, a full charge, took me north of 1 hour which is not too long, as it gave me ample amount of time to completely change my phone too. Once charged, i was using sporadically for about 4-5 hours each day, and it lasted me 4 days. This setup has been ongoing since Jun'20. As such, I can safely vouch that these earphones truly deliver on the promises made by OnePlus.Go for it. Please click on the thumbs up icon if you liked my review.\\n\", '\\n  I had ordered this earphone about a week ago and on opening of the box i found out that \"Never Settle\" tagline was missing. Also extra earbuds was not there. So i compared the audio quality of my earphones with one of my friend\\'s oneplus bullets z earphone and i found out that my earphone\\'s quality was pathetic compared to his earphone. I am giving a decent rating to the audio quality, noise cancellation and bass quality of the earphones based on what i heard on my friend\\'s earphone. But maybe i got a fake product or a defective one which in both cases are not expected from Amazon,which is why i am rating it to the lowest. So beware buyers when u receive such product and order for a return/replacement asap.\\n', '\\n  I am using this for a month now and the Product is really good. Howeverif you are really a Bass Lover, this does not suit you. It does not have good Bass and volume is medium and many of the Products which are cheaper than this provides good Bass and high volume.If you want to use it for more than one device at the same time, it will not automatically switch. There is a button which you need to press it twice to switch from one device to another. If you have paired with more than 2 or 3 devices, then it does confuse and you need to manually connect from your device. You have Samsung Level U / Mulo bluetooth earphones, which automatically switch between devices.If you really play with Magnets of earbuds during when you are idle, this will really mess you up. As power off is through putting two earbuds together. So whenever you separate two earbuds, it turns on and joining the earbuds will turn off. So, please be cautious.Noise Cancellation seems pretty good.It is so flexible and whenever you keep it down, it may just twist the whole earphone.But if you are Brand Lover, then this is the one you need to go for a lower cost.\\n', \"\\n  Dear Sir,I had purchased One Plus Bullet Wireless Z on 18.06.2020 which was delivered to me on 22.06.2020.I had used since received l, it was working fine with One Plus 7 phone.After 20day's of usage (since 12.07.2020) headphone is not connecting with One Plus 7 also tried to connect with other phone however still head phone is not connecting.

The bass quality is really decent at this price range. The sound clarity is also good. The noise cancellation is not that much.. when you put the music on full volume only then you’ll not be able to hear anyone or background sound. The build quality is good. The charging is same as promised by one plus. At this price range it’s really worth buying them! If you’re looking for a decent pair of earphones then you must definitely Go for it!!\\n', \"\\n  Hey I used OnePlus bullet wireless Z neckband earphone.Here I faced the issues•While playing games it strucks and delay(late) sounds.•While playing game automatically error and my team can't hear my voice. (I changed to the my regular earphone then my team can hear me) it happened multiple times.•Also there is no protection for charger port USB CAP (like other brands have it) from sweat and water flash. Am very much worried about this.I used multiple times and I found the issues. My friends also complained multiple times they can't hear my voice while playing game (this issue only while playing game not in calls).\\n\", \"\\n  Let me write crisp short and correct review!First thing, music quality is good not bad however it's not exceptional. Bass quality is good, make sure you select correct earbuds n choose what fits and suits you. Balance and vocals are clear and loudness is also fine. If you are hardcore metal music lover it's not the correct choice ,considering to price fact it's good!Calls are amazingly good and you can hear person on other side very well and the person can hear you and surrounding as well. Noice cancellation is not taken care of which is sad, but good for lovers 😍. If you whisper even it's understandable as I do with my ;-)It's very good in build quality and battery backup is very good.Bollywood music lovers are not going to complaint for music quality.Overall conclusion, if you are looking for good music quality, call quality and battery back up go for it.\\n\", \"\\n  I received the earphones before time. I was really to receive this pair. The looks and feel of the product is really really premium. The sound quality is equivalent to the Sennheiser CX275 In-Ears, meaning it is above expectation and above the value for money.  The battery back-up is really amazing and gave me an 18 hr backup. It charges real quick, 20 min to full charge.But there are some issues related to this particular earphone which I received: 1. The Bluetooth disconnected in between the call multiple times despite the fact that I was close to my one plus 6t. 2. The buds kinda slip out of my ear, and I found this very disheartening because all the reviews which I saw on youtube kinda portrayed it that it won't slip out of your ear. Even with the slightest walking and having the optimum size of buds in the ear which do not tend to move while I'm sitting, surprisingly slips out of my ear and I have to adjust them again and again.3. The mic is not that great, a lot of people complained that my voice is getting too much surround, and it is too jizzy leaving the listener with a lot of irritation. I kinda got pissed of explaining the same thing 2-3 times to the person other side and I 've to bring the mic really close to my mouth, which would again result in pulling the left bud out of my ear. Heck. At times I have to literally shout to make the other person listen.I don't know whether this problem is with my particular piece, or is it with everyone?\\n\", \"\\n  I saw a lot of YouTube reviews of this product and quite some reviews in Amazon itself. Knowing what risk I shall be taking I took the leap and bought it today. I'm spellbound and the sound quality is really superb. Many complained about its bass quality but trust me it is not bad. It doesn't sound like any cheap earphones. The bass is good and perfect for easy, smooth listening. I played some electronic dance, house, pop and hard rock music. All returned nice acceptable punch. Nowhere did I feel, the sound quality is cheap or the bass is like hitting on a plank. I will strongly recommend this product for its utility, battery life, Quick Switch button and overall quality of it.\\n\", \"\\n  Stopped working on 14th day of delivery .Battery is good but of no use as volume button , play , pause button suddenly stopped working .Can't reset it .

Battery life2. Fast changing3.quick connection4. Overall sound quality is good for non bass heavy personCons:1.Bass ( i will give 3/5 for bass untill you push your low to very high and increase bass in EQ you can't fell any bass )Other recommendations:If your only concern is sound quality and you can live refurbished product with 12-13 hours of battery you should go forrefurbished sony WI XB400 it is 200₹ costly but great sound quality.( I am personally using Amazon 3 refurbished item till the date i didn't face any problem).\\n\", \"\\n  To be frank after using this headphone I am not at all happy about this headphones. I have done a lot of reaseach by viewing many videos on youtube but my experience is totally opposite to what I have been told. Apart from battery life nothing is good.While making a call you will experience a lot of humming.If you are great fan of quality music please don't buy it instead use a good quality wired headphones. I have lost my 2000 Rs. On these headphones but If you are reading this i want you to save your money still if you want to purchase a BT headphones go for Realme BT headphones.Even i am struggling to connect oneplus customer care but you will not get any options for other OP product.Please don't buy these useless overrated headphones.\\n\", '\\n  Budget gadget.Built quality - AcceptableColour combination - Nice👂 fit - GoodSound quality -  acceptableBass - averageNoise cancellation - okLetency  - not noticeable ( 5*)Battery - It last for three days with moderate use ( per day usage :- 1-2hrs phone call, 2-3 hrs gaming, 1-2 hrs video)Neckband fitting : good fit for tall guy ( < 6 feet height) like me :)Recommendations : just improve sound output and reduce price by ₹200, it will hit the market.\\n', \"\\n  The earphones build quality is great, loved it and also i liked the color and audio qualityThe only problem i encountered on the unit i have received was the left earbud was falling off the ear no matter now good i try to adjust or fit it inside even after trying to change the eartips provided with the productAnother issue was low battery life, i only got maximum of 8 to 9 hours of battery backup after testing it for 3 consecutive full charges. It's possible that the issue seems to be only with my unit and not present on all others.\\n\", \"\\n  I have realme buds, but as an employee I need to take lot of calls. For buds, u need to continuously keep in ear which will reduce its battery, eventually u need to keep them in charging box. So I chose neck band for my purpose. I can take calls when ever it's necessary without draining its battery. Call clarity is very good (my main purpose). And after listening to music in this, I was blown out by its clarity. Each and every instrument is audible. Bass is sufficient for avg indian user unless u r a DJ mix listener. I listen melody songs which are fantastic in this.\\n\", '\\n  The device is top class for the given price tag ☺️.Nothing out there give as much fast charge capabilities and 20 hours back up in one awesome package. The sound quality is bit on the bass heavy side little too much for me but over all the mic quality is way much better than I expected from and not so \"sound\" concious brand. Hardly any noise cancellation even with the ears plug drivers 🙄.Anyways for this range it\\'s one of the best for worry less wireless experience unless there is 18-20 hour full wireless solution out there. Bonus it\\'s future ready cause it\\'s \"type c\" so just one cable for my pixel and headphones.I would say go for it if you want to use wireless headphones and not worry how often you will need to charge it throughout the day 😉 I got this for my other family members 😊 they super happy in lockdown no fuss on cables.😂\\n', \"\\n  I like the battery backup of this OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z, it gives a lot of backup. But the problem I found in my OP BW Z is the battery will be drained completely even after switching off & when not in use for a long period. I've noticed this issue just a day after my return policy ended. And the 10min charge for 10 hour backup is not at all working for me. Yesterday at 3pm I stopped using my OP BW Z with 60% charge when I switched off the device. Today at 10am when I tried to connect with my phone, the device was dead. And I used a timer for 10 minutes of charge & waited for a 10hrs of backup. But I just fished up with no charge left either. My friend also purchased the same on the same day & was using for the same time. But he's not having any of the issue I'm facing. I'm very much disappointed with my purchase and I don't know what to say. Yesterday I called the OP customer service for raising this issue & he asked me to reset the device and go for a trial to look at the issue is still there or not. But still I'm having the same issue with my device. Hell lot of disappointment with my OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z.\\n\", \"\\n  Overall product is good as you can expect from OnePlus . Issue i face is while playing pubg , my voice is not audible to my teammates during game , sometimes they can hear me and sometimes they can't hear me.  I would better spend my money on an earphones which are complet package for audio and mic performance.Thankyou\\n\", \"\\n  This is really good product with the magnetic earbuds that joins together to go to sleep mode and then once separated then quickly gets connected back (similar to realme buds). Major drawback is this doesn't have a dual pairing simultaneously.Also there is a struggtin switching over to the last 2 devices using the quick switch button.The battery back up is good to last for a day's hectic use or for 2 days on moderate usage.Note: you would be provided with a C-type mini cable and it could be used to your existing charger head or connect it to rhe usb slot of your computer or car. It gets 0-100 within 1.75 hours and a quick charge of 15 mins should last for half a day while used with 50% volume s\\n\", '\\n  helloI am  a die hard fan of oneplus right from oneplus one to oneplus 8 pro ,now i even purchased  this bluetooth bullets z wireless headset.Initially i was happy with the purchase ,sound quality was very good, what they call the low latency is perfect for gaming , but bass was not enough since i was using Skullcandy Crusher  headset for gaming , may be that was the reason ..Now its been 2 months and just today right side earphone is giving very volume compared to left one, it tried resetting headset and nothing seems to be working , i dont know suddenly what happened..For the first time i am very much disappointed with the purchase of oneplus product.\\n', '\\n  I read a lot of review stating bass is not good in this earphones and I was in doubt whether to go for it..however using it for last one week, this is an awesome earphone with the best kind of clear vocal, bass, midtone & treble. May be I have a OnePlus phone and this may be enhancing the sound quality. Also build quality is not so bad with a macho battery. Movie watching experience was also very good.bI think If the bass is further increased, then we can only here the beats and nothing else. There is no active noise cancellation on this earphone. On calls mobile phone do that part of noise cancellation so that person at other end can hear clearly.I would recommend this to all..Just go for it....overall this is superb value for money and last long...\\n', '\\n  Sound Quality is decent some might feel the bass and lows are not adequate, if you are someone who has used some bigger driver earphones or the ones on the premium side, you might feel they are not the best sounding earphones. But considering the price at which are offered it totally justifies what they offer so cant complain about that. Overall built quality feels fine , it is mostly plastic but not the cheap one.The best part is the battery life and the quick charge feature that just makes them stand out.Talking about latency its quite minimal not just on OnePlus but on other devices as well.Overall a decent buy. Best in this price bracket.7/10\\n', \"\\n  Great product. Sound quality is balanced. It's decent not too much bass which I like.Noise cancellation isn't there. But even in loud env, other person was able to hear me clear and loud despite the noise around me. Noise would pass but won't bother much.Battery is a great plus. It lasts really long, easily 16-18hrs.Very fast to conned the device as soon as I detach the 2 buds.Easy to switch between 2 recent devices.Overall good package and I am loving it.Bought this after trying Oppo Enco M31 and oneplus buds as well.\\n\", \"\\n  I have 2 Headphone one is Mi and another is OnePlus but both has some quality.If you want bass thwn its not for you.Go with MI sport Headphone.If your main need is battery backup then its for you.But remember one thing its has 10 min chanrge and 10 hour battery backup. Its only for if you are charged this Headphone with OnePlus dash carger.This feature is only with OnePlus charger not for others.Apart form that its good .But i more like with mi Headphone because of mi don't have neckband and you can easily put into your pocket\\n\", '\\n  In this budget you cannot beat this one. Voice is crisp and clear and unimaginable battery life. Extra features (most of them work with one plus devices) a few of them work cross platform like connecting 2 devices which can be toggled. For call voice ranges in between 3 rooms if your phone is kept away.for music lovers, balanced trebble and bass, but not superb. I primarily use it for taking calls and watching videos on youtube. Excellent packaging, though I feel the ear bud quality could be a little better. Fast charging helps as I have dash charger. For a daily driver you cannot get better than this.\\n', \"\\n  Quick Snapshot And Honest Review After 3 Months.Pros - 1. Battery Advantage, Quick Charge - Still amazing  2. Lightweight and Ease of Handle - Still amazing  3. Build Quality - No compromise (plastic but no  issues)  4. Sound Quality - Gentle, bass is average but not  very bad. I tweaked the base with earphone  settings in oneplus. Not very much difference but  improved a bit.Cons. - 1. Mic - Biggest Con. Everyone complains, i need to  throw the earphone off everytime on call.  Ofcourse, forget any recording. Signal processing is  too bad, it catches far audio frequency and boosts  it. People will listen to that before you.  2. Connectivity - It is quick but sometimes it gets in  a beep mode and in that case you need to restart it  again and again. The buttons won't respond much.  3. Device Change Feature - If you have more than 2  devices, then very often you will struggle  sometimes even when you disconnect it from  previous devices. Exact 2 devices won't create much  issue.  4. Earpieces - Got loose overtime, they get out  sometimes. Well a problem with most earphones,  this isn't a special case.Overall, why do you need this earphone if it doesn't have a good mic?To listen music??With manageable bass?Seriously?I am compromising. Need a repair, in case it is just my product which is defective. Please Suggest how to get a repair. I have checked their website, there i saw phone and tv repair options only. Any leads?\\n\", '\\n  After using for few days, this is my overall reviewSound: Amazing sound, with all low and high notes  are easily audible.Battery: Amazing battery backup with 18 to 20 hrs playtime depending on audio volume.Charging: Really quick as compared to other wireless earphone.Bass: Little less bass as thought. If you are looking for heavy bass earphone, this is not the one.Noice cancellation: Experienced it to some extent.Calling: As the placement of mic is awesome, person whom you are calling can hear you clearly.Purchased it for my mom and she loves it.\\n', '\\n  Pros :- good sound quality, good bass, good for pubg game for spotting enemy by sound, clear sound, earphone quality awesome, battery backup really 18 -19 hours, fast charging if you\\'ve one plus adapter(25 minutes) otherwise 35 minutes for full charge, you\\'ll get 2 extra pair of buds and cable with it (check small packet in backside properly)..

It's bad in bass & I don't even feel it.Oneplus is increasing prices & decreasing quality of their products.

Just best.Audio call quality is fine.Buttons are easy to use...Overall a good experience....Will roughly give 8 points on a scale of 10.Thank you 😀👍\\n', \"\\n  This NeckBand is awesome, It is way more better than my expectations. Actually I'm a headphone guy but I tried this band this is just awesome. Let me explain something first of all the BATTERY is just excellent not only fast charging but also the backup is very good, Talking about the SOUND QUALITY, it is simply very very clear and focused if u love to listen music this is for u. If I tell u about BASE, first thing this is not a base NeckBand but still when u listen a song u will ofcourse feel something just trembling your ears (just a little). Talking about notice cancellation, After u *wear this u won't be able to listen anything outside. My mom complaints that she shouts but I don't respond when this is on😂. Now Talking about GAMING, I played PUBG wearing this earphone the sound was different, what I want u to tell that the sound is very *thin kind of, I don't remember when I took any foot advantage in pubg after wearing it but still I play using this one only cauz pubg is not everything.And also I did not realised any latency issue till now even though I know it's thereNOTE: this earphones were delivered to me 5 days ago  by the way delivery was quite before expected 👍🏽JUST BUY IT!!!

I tested it once and I got 19 hrs 30 mins (close to what was advertised).Sound Quality - Actually very good for the price. Highs, Mids and instrument separation is pretty good.Bass - Didn't find it thumping like how Indians like. But slight tweaking of the EQ and the earphone pumps boom boom sound.Durability - Looks fantastic. Should last for at least few years.Controls - Controls are good and the instant pair by separating the magnetic pairs.Overall I am happy with the purchase.\\n\", \"\\n  I have gone through several YouTube reviews and customer reviews before ordering.And i am happy to be writing this review wearing the earphones.The sound quality is perfect for my music taste.Wonderful earphones with the best battery backup and within the price range.On 02.05.2020, i tested the charging time from 0-100% with one plus 7T's wrap charger and the results come to 49 minutes.Also i have been using this for 2 complete days and getting the backup of around 15hours which is the best in this segment.Hope these results help others.\\n\", \"\\n  Its a superb headset. You can go for it without 2nd thought. Nice build quality, Nice packing, Sharp and clear sound, decent bass, voice assistance, heavy battery backup upto 20 hrs, 10 hours with 10 minute charging.Main thing i liked most is that this product is having dual device pairing and also can easily change over to other device with double pressing on a button which makes my work from home easier. Instantly it will change within 2 seconds if both device bluetooth is on. Its flexible, we can keep in pocket if we want and also water proof.Bass is good and decent, not that deep. But i liked it very much.I have bought this after a lot of researches and product reviews. I got what I was expecting and what I wanted.Delivered in 2 days.#NEVER SETTLE...  Go for it...UNFORTUNATELY IT'S STOPPED WORKING AFTER FEW DAYS. I'M RETURNING THE ITEM.\\n\", \"\\n  Latency only works with Oneplus Devices. So please stop complaining about delays. I'm finding it perfect @2K price.Bass is Good' you just have to adjust your Equalizer.But Voice Quality is Awesome 💕  it feels like music is playing in my head.Feeling no pain after using continuosly 4-5 hrs.Sound Quality 5/5.Build Quality 5/5.Bass 4/5.Voice 5/5.Battery 10/5.I'm using with my Oneplus 8.Edit- After using a week I'm really impressed.No Delay in Pubg ( not even 0.0001Sec) it's perfect for Pubg. I think Latency only works with Oneplus Devices. Because i used with my redmi note 6Pro and found delay in Pubg.It's light weight and great for Calls.No pain in ear.But low Noise Cancellation.Battery is good as expected but showing imperfect battery percentage.Everything is fine.Well I'm recommending to only Oneplus users' due to some extra features.\\n\", '\\n  Really impressed 🙌 with the product quality. Great OnePlus this time you have done excellent 👍 work.Battery is awesome - It is giving me around 22+ hours of backup.Bass - sound quality is good but you have to compromise little bit with the bassProduct quality- 8/10 built quality is better than other products available in the market.Overall experience is very good REALLY impressed with the product and combination of this product with the OnePlus devices is tremendous.\\n', '\\n  One Plus Bullets Wireless Z.Bought it for 2K.This is my third Bluetooth wireless earphone.Have used this for about 2weeks before writing the review.Pros :~Battery life is amazing.I actually charged the device for 10-15 min to test how long it works.Easily goes for 6-7hrs...~Reconnects superfast.~Pairs with 2 device with ease and switches without much hassle.~When full charged lasts for a day...Cons:~With 10mins charge shows 100% and full charge actually takes 30-40min Which is the ideal 100%.That way its difficult to ascertain actual charge.~ Music is not top notch.~One Plus should provide option to change music setting atleast on One Plus device.\\n', \"\\n  I guess amazon has started selling duplicate products. As you can see first pic(i bought this one) in which earphone is there inside box or anywhere in the box never settle is not written and product is defected mic is not working properly. Im second pic never settle is written which is bought by my friend and working super.I guess amazon doesn't valued their customer and selling duplicate or defective piece. Stop buying products from amazon or online\\n\", \"\\n  This headset looks and feels like the excellent Bullets Wireless 2. Features such as USB Type-C port, fast charging, very good battery life, and Quick Switch are impressive given the ₹ 1,999 price. When it comes to sound quality, OnePlus hasn't pushed any boundaries with the Bullets Wireless Z, you get what you expect with these earphones. However, the overall package is still good enough to call this our new favourite wireless headset priced at under ₹ 2,000.\\n\", '\\n  Pros :1.Insane battery life2.Good sound quality3.magnetic on\\\\off4.splash proof/(sweat)5.@ this price6.pair within 2 secondsCons:1.cant expect sound quality like 1more or Skullcandy earphones(bass ,treble,mid is ok)...................................I think @ this price sound quality not a big point. Its okay.Pairing is Gorgeous.Cable quality is fine.One and only thing i liked much more is its mic.Its placed perfectly that stays beside cheeks so that third person listen you voice without any noise and also has 3 button on that.This mechanism is totally worth in this price.\\n', \"\\n  Pro'sGood quality earphones.Excellent sound quality.Bass is also good, I don't know why people are saying no bass. Try it yourself.Battery is amazing.Mic is also good, but not fully noise cancellation with mic.Conssmall blinking led is light too bright, i have covered it using tape.Sometimes if you touch the wire you can hear some sounds.Overall very good product and worth the price.\\n\", '\\n  First time i have found an earphone with connects to 2 devices at the same time and switches between them with just a button press, put both the ear phones together with inbuilt magnet and it disconnects and i am really impressed by its battery life... wow.for me its a must buy... initially i was facing some issues but later learnt that it was my phone and not the earphone.If you want a real sound, balanced sound, go for it... if you looking for Bass dont buy this.\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality, noise cancellation are good and built-in quality is also decent. Coming to connectivity, automatically getting connected when earbuds pulled away, it mostly takes 5 seconds to get connected. speaking of BASS QUALITY iam sort of disappointed in this. I have been using this product from 2 days now. I mostly listen to music and i found out that bass is lower that expected. I also played pubg and figured out that there is 1-3sec of latency but it didn't caused much problem but still its a lacking point. And battery life is good. Iam using this from 2 days since i recieved the product which is given with 100% charge, it is still good with 80% charge. Overall everything is very good but i feel that bass can be little more good.After 3 weeks of usage :-It stopped working after using just 3 weeks..... I am unable to listen from the earphones, i used very carefully but still they stopped working.And then after few more weeks it started working again. However a problem occurred in very early stage.\\n\", \"\\n  Why all others are writing such a bad reviews for this OnePlus product.It is actually a genuine and pro quality product not like the cheap realme Bluetooth headset.Charging is best in class type-c port and Max halfnr for complete charging,I am normal user and I had used it 2 weeks 3days without charging it.Actually I didn't notice any bass problem.It does have minimum bass and we can clearly all the other instruments used in a songVoices are crystal clear from both sides during even long calls like 1hr or 2hr calls😂😂\\n\", '\\n  Now to make things clear this is not my primary pair of headphones ! I own Bose 700 & Planing to buySony WM-1000MX4 and the sole intention was to wear for walks during rain and so that those expensive sets don’t get spoiled during rains.Pros:-Comfortable - Can wear for hours long and no pressure on ears and after few min you forget you have it on .Battery Life - Good battery backup , I could get almost the claimed time by the company ie- 16-17 hrs on one chargeFast Charging - Charges quick 10min 3-4 hrs and Full charge 20-30min without fast charging bricksIntegration - Had herd that device swapping don’t work unless you don’t have and one + device which is not the case  Been using it with my iPhone 11 and iPad 6 and switches device with double click !  Buds on/off works perfect ( stuck together off , pulled away from each other on)Phone Quality :- speaking on phone call is very good , isolates background noise- mediocreCons:-Sound Quality  - Small drivers 9.2 mm so the sound is not deafening loud but is quite loud . But the quality is kind of good but bass is low to mediocre. Clarity is good. So it’s kinda hit and miss on low to mid.Charging spaces is not covered with a rubber flap so water can ingress and cause problems.The wire quality from the batteries to respective earbuds should have been more thick or good quality.Should have had options in remote to skip/reverse a song (if there please let me know) which is a bummer!Overall it’s is recommended for the price and for who wants to get into kinda wireless ( not true wireless) headphones and who need it for day to day use !\\n', \"\\n  For all who say the bass is average may be used to listening to the heavy bassed English rocks songs or something.I found the true to music quality amazing.  The battery life is to be seen to be believed.  I am using it at around 60% sound and having used it for listening to movie and utube and some songs ( 60-85 hindi songs, ARR Tamil, 70s to 90 s Malayalam) I feel this is best suited to my taste.  The battery after 9hours approx usage is around 75 %.  That's mind blowing.  Yesudas , Rafi and SPb and kishore and jagjit sound amazing without any tinkering of equilizers and after tweking even Arjit & kumar sanu sound good.I used to listen to over the ear head phones from Sennheiser and this sounds almost similar ( Sennheiser wins in the sound stage and sound signature  dept by some).  That one costs atleast twice of this 4 years back and was said to be of studio quality.I would say this is best for the 70s to 2000 music.\\n\", \"\\n  My sad review : 😭Cons:1) Right ear bud is not working after one month of usage.2) During calls you cannot listen YouTube videos or other online streamingvideos 😡 unless it's saved on your local phones. This feature present on any cheap bluetooth 👂phones.3) sometimes it's disconnecting bluetooth automatically during the calls with full charge.4) It won't fix in helmet while driving bike.Pros :1) Fast charging & long lasting 🔋2) lite weight3) built quality & sound is impressive.4) if magnets are connected as neck band, sound automatically pauses and Bluetooth band will be turns off.My trust on oneplus brand is broken :(\\n\", \"\\n  The lite version of the bullets is here! OnePlus brings the budget wireless earphones for the gamers and music buffs! A major upgrade for me from wired earphones as this is my first wireless earphone. Though I'll always prefer wired ones as I am an audio engineer myself. The design is pretty neat and the strap is flexible and can twist and turn too. It sits very lightly around your neck and is hardly noticeable. It comes with 3 pairs of buds to suit your ears. The biggest plus point of this is the monstrous battery life. It took an hour to charge and I use it everyday atleast for 3-4 hours, yet the battery takes around a week to go down to 0. Points for that! Connectivity is not an issue at all as I use a Oneplus phone. But for others too it will be smooth as this one's got bluetooth 5.0. the major feature this one's got is low latency. Now although this works only with the Oneplus fanatic mode and not other phones, this feature is great news for all those PUBG lovers. The audio is synced and so gaming is fun on this. Now let me come to the sound quality. As I said that this is a lite version of the OnePlus Bullets V2, The lower price does have some impact on the specifications of the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z. The most notable of these is that the headset has a single dynamic driver in each earpiece, and also doesn't support the aptX Bluetooth codec; there's just SBC and AAC support on the Bullets Wireless Z. With the price duly considered, the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z offers exactly what is expected when it comes to sound quality. Although the insightfulness and detail we experienced on the original Bullets Wireless wasn't quite there because of the lack of aptX support, the sound still had plenty of drive and attack to it.Also, the magnetic switch here allows lesser buttons to deal with. These earphones are valid for money but even better for a kneplus phone user cuz of the OnePlus ecosystem.\\n\", '\\n  Is this happened just with me.... Battery drops like 100-80-60-40-20-dead..... Or happened to you guys as well\\n', \"\\n  OnePlus always keeps up its Brand value... I had used almost 3 wireless bluetooth heatsets... This is the best of all... Out of all the three (Boats, Realme and OnePlus), the premium is shown the most not only in product but also in packing, that is ONEPLUS....Qualitu of Sound, connectivity, noise cancelation everything is perfect and I'm totally satisfied with it..To say about BASS, am quite okay with the performance... May be BASS lovers may feel it little low...To talk about Battery its aaaawwwwssooommmeeee.... Its been 3 days am using it with one time 100% charge... Still 30% left... Even if u use continuously it can last for atleast 20hrs...Highly recommended for buying... You ll never get disappointed..\\n\", '\\n  Disclaimer- I haven’t taken many calls on this product, is currently my primary product for music.The sound quality is good, very balanced— although the bass tends to overpower sometime- which is manageable through your equaliser settings. I don’t think there is any other product out there that has this good build quality, ease of use, sound quality and weight (which is just comfortable) at this price range.If you’re in for an earphone, i recommenced you cut the noise and order this!\\n', \"\\n  I had to switch between laptop and mobile since WFH started. Was looking out for wireless headphones which can switch between the 2 very easily.Bullets wireless Z made my life easier. Just double tap to switch between the devices.I am using it for taking calls and other party never complained about the voice. Mic is also good.Headphone lasts 2 to 3 days with single charge since I am only using it for calls.Built quality is also good.Music is pretty average though.If you are looking for wireless headphones for office work only then buy wireless Z. If your priority is music then by something else. It won't satisfy the audiophile in you.\\n\", '\\n  The best thing I liked is1. it can connect 2 devices at once.2. I can switch from laptop to mobile device in just a double tap3. Build quality at the best4. Microphone is something unique. Previously I used Samsung level u, Level u pro, u-flex and jbl.5. When both headphone is attached in magnet, the device disconnects itself from our device. When put in ear, it connects in seconds. Thats the best thing to save batteryCons:Bass could be better. Still sounds great\\n', \"\\n  I was using oneplus' wired earphones till now and tbh i didn't notice any difference in the audio quality....people are saying that the driver is small and that bass is not as good but if you are a casual user then you won't notice any difference......the low latency mode does work and while playing pubg there is no sort of audio lag whatsoever.....The earphones get connected as soon as i put them on....the quick connect works perfectly with my oneplus 7Battery life is amazing.... I've used it for 4 days today and every day I've played pubg for 3 hours and i just keep them on all the time and I've only charged them once for 30 minutes yesterday and right now it's at 90%If you're looking for wireless earphones under 2000rs. This is the best\\n\", '\\n  The earphones are a perfect blend of sound, battery and budget. For those worried about lack of base, please try the bigger earbuds provided in the accessories pack, that will help.\\n', '\\n  First time user of wireless headset. Loved the battery life 2 days of 6-8 hrs usage 40% battery used. Sound quality is good, though I feel the wired headsets are still much better in terms of sound and the music (samsung HS 130 and JBL headphones user) but my OP 7t does not has jack option and connector has not been durable enough. Headsets material is sturdy not flimsy, looks durable. Bluetooth connection has been great, have roamed around my home keeping phone in one room with uninterrupted music on the loop. For me it scores 8/10, for bass part not that great.\\n', \"\\n  This is a real, boombastic, competitive, pure budget earphones by one of the best brand OnePlus. It fits with almost phones even with iPhone. Yeah... Airpod doesn't support with Android phones but here they do! No discrimination! Bass quality, noise cancellation, light weight, superior Colour, build quality is OK. Have used plastic material yet studdy. Comes with fast charging (damn fast). Takes 20 to 30 mins in full charge. Once full charge, battery life is amazing. Auto play and pause function is very useful. Low latency experience. Price 1999 and if you have Amazon pay balance, more power to you. Lol. Buy without any hesitation. Coool product.\\n\", \"\\n  I love shopping with Appario Retail Private Ltd, they have almost no diffective products. But first time ever the delivery was very late.About Oneplus wireless z is a premium product. Compared to realme neckband i would say u will face a lil issue of loudness. Because realme is louder around 30% more. But it doesn't mean that this product does not wort buying. The buds are almost weightless. Sound quality is superb. The issues are not made for heavy bass heads and loud music listeners.\\n\", \"\\n  I would like to give 4/5 ⭐.The product is really a deal breaker considering the price point and other available product segment on this price range.Pros :Good build quality. As soon as you hold the earpiece you feel it's premiumness.Super smooth and easy to use connectivity. Add on features like switch device option between last two paired.Google assistance built inMic is good and captures the voice accurately hence other party during call won't get any lag or disturbances.Sound quality is decent but not great.Important aspect is the battery life. I used the product on day 1 for almost 5.30-6 hrs. The battery % was 80 out of box and post use it was 55. Hence I would say battery life is really great and it's cherry on the cake with the fast 30w charge.Cons:I think many users already complained on this which is low bass and not so great sound quality, though I would say the vocals were great and lower notes are quite pleasant.So one us really needs to work on this area as this is the prolonged issue with all their wireless devices.Other than that it's really a good product to have and I strongly recommend. At this price range other products may beat this on sound area but overall the product is good most important is OnePlus branding and services.\\n\", '\\n  BEST bluetooth earphone available, in the given price range. I already possess 3pairs of bluetooth earphones and this is the BEST hands down!Exactly as advertised it gives great battery backup, the sound quality is GREAT 👍🏻(especially during calls), its so fluid to switch between devices. I am using it across devices from ipad to my oneplus 👍🏻 no issues. Incredible deal, dont miss. Thanks to amazon for early delivery and to oneplus for making such incredible products. 😎\\n', '\\n  I had purchased OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z which was ideally suitable for my Oneplus8, the running was great where with a minimal time of charge it would suffice me for hours together of video and audio, but alas after one month of use , i am finding that the volume levels have changed in both the ears where the right side makes more sound and the left side volume is feeble .I am very much disappointed with oneplus for the first time .\\n', \"\\n  Phenomenal product yet again by OnePlus. I had been using Boat Rockerzz for past one year. So I will put forward a basic comparison with that. Also I am a normal user. By that I mean, that I am not into much gaming, see videos on youtube, prime etc, listen to music. However I am not extremely cautious of bass, pitch, intensity, noise, and other technicalities. From a non technical-user perspective, whatever(problem/benefit) is not visible to me, I am not writing it.1. Bluetooth range is better than boat rockerzz. No problems anywhere 7-10m. Easy when you roam around in house. However, when battery is 30%, I noticed inconsistent sound at same range. Overall. I would say its better than rest.2. The switch on-off system of earphone is linked to magnets. When magnets are together, the earphone is automatically switched off. Takes off the effort of switching it on-off everytime.3. Connects to phone within 1-2 seconds. This is smooth and flawless, coupled with point 2. However, I have only tried it with my OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 7. Also, it is not as flawless in switching between phones. I had to disconnect/turn off bluetooth of one phone to connect it with another.4. Charges really really fast. 10 min 10 hours. 1 hour full charge, as it says. Also battery lasts for 3 days with normal calls. This period doesn't take into account music or movie. But even then it is highly efficient compared to its competitors.5. Please refer to other comments for sound, bass quality. Etc\\n\", \"\\n  It is a balance product, don't know why people are making fuzz about its bass & all. Maybe in India people like to listen shadi wala bass where music go to hell, only the thumping..The JBL 200 something wired earphones have 9mm driver and this product has 9.2 mm driver.. So, according to me it sounds same as those jbl's earphones... Lasted 2 days without charging, attended 2-3 long calls, listened mysic, audiobook, watched 2 full movies.. and in the last left with 10% charge, and this is all when it came with full charge out of the box.Saw review of samsung's fast charger charging this, didn't saw much advantage, but when I charged it with my Quick charger (18 Watt Nokia) (Qualcomm powered technology) results were great for charging.. sure dash charger will be charging way better...\\n\", \"\\n  It is absolutely up to the markWhat i thought it's beyond then thatSound quality is oweseome, battery life excellentCharge for onlee 15 min. At use it till next 8 to 10 hrs uninterrupted more important it has some kind of senser in itWhile u will not have the ear piece in ur ear it will be on stand byAnd if u use any of the mobile app mobipe speakers will workBut when u will put the ear piece in ur ear it will automatically get connectedThat is wonder feature tht i admire and gaming my oh my excellentOver all paisa, wasool one\\n\", \"\\n  The one plus bullets wireless Z are an amazing choice for the sub ₹2,000 price range!There is minimal latency in use, and I always kept an eye out to try and notice it.They keep charge for a sufficient amount of time, and live up to their promised hours. Charging them also takes very less time and it is super convenient if you have a oneplus phone.The main reason for my purchase was convenience, like the feature to switch between two devices by double tapping a button, quick charge ability and minimal latency.Sound is good, nothing great. Bass is pretty weak, you will absolutely feel it while listening to songs with strong beats. Calls are crystal clear, so a trade off here for a gain there, all in all, is it value for money? Well, that depends on what your priorities are. If you want a pair of earphones that you can multitask with, keep them in your ears for a long time, and that don't take much time to recharge, these are the ones you're looking for. Their sound quality is good, all the sounds are clear and nice, except for the bass. So if you want a wholesome sound experience, then you might like to look elsewhere. But otherwise, you can't go wrong with these.\\n\", \"\\n  Its an awesome product from 1+.Battery- i didn't charge it even once in a day and it is still going on straight out of the box. WARP charge is really doing good.Connectivity-  Again its best in its class no issues in 10 m range.Comfort- It is quite comfortable in every situation.Sound quality- BASS is just GREAT. Its neither less nor over emphasized.Crystal clear vocals and instruments are delivered.Twin device support-  It connects with 2 devices at a time and can be seamlessly switched.Before buying thing i had many devices in mind but now m totally satisfied since it costs only 2k.\\n\", \"\\n  Pros:1. Connecting to smartphone and swapping inbetween 2 devices is a breeze2. Awesome battery life. Charged after 5 days of regular usage.3. Completely charges in just 25-30 min4.  Works without distortion of sound or call from other room when mobile is being charged in different room5. Music quality is very good, didn't miss heavy bass.6. Overall a very good product andAnd if budget permits can be purchased without any hesitation.BUT ..CONS:One major drawback I encountered was during riding bike. Lots of wind noise is heard to the person on call.And when taking a call on open space during moderate breez also wind sound is heard.Kindly consider the above cons if you are using more of two wheeler or working in open space / windly area.Other than than its a definately a worth buying product\\n\", \"\\n  Relative Comparison with my older Sony MIC200, TWS wireless Pods, Soundpeats q7Sound quality is greatIn ear buds ergonomics - dint like it. Should have been identical. Need to get used to which ones left and which ones right. For music is understood but for calls who cares.Wire: is not flat but round Yes!!! I can feel the insulation will crack / wear out if stuck..Battery life is v.good. Probably because the magnet buds function as on and off and it's annoying as before call you end up seperating them to get connected. Security point its good you won't drop/ loose them.The flashing LED light is too bright in dark - I don't prefer it again good to track if you loose in dark.Functions still getting used to I liked Sony's simple double tap functions to switch songs using volume keys here is the single key double and triple tap!! Also Sony has feature to start music by just long press this doesnt have it.Bought considering water resistant and sports usage  but don't have guts to test it ajay screwed One plus 6 now using 7T. Plus the charging port doesn't have cover unlike Sony.Rated 4 orly based on sound quality.Overall well packaged and delivered\\n\", \"\\n  I have a OnePlus phone and I was obviously interested once the product was announced. Of course the pricing was spot on. I had to wait for long due to the delivery restrictions during COVID situation. Meanwhile, I got to see polarized opinions on it. Nevertheless, I wanted to get my hands on it. Finally after 3 weeks of wait ordered one.Likes:1. Comfort - The headphone is very comfort to long usage2. Battery - This is enough. It just takes ~25 minutes to charge fully with my Dash Charger. This is more than enough for someone like me. I plan things in advance. Thanks to one plus, now charging my Phone and headphone is out of the list.3. Quick Switch - Works perfectly fine. Connected this earphone with my mobile and my wife's. Now switching between them is very easy.4. Quick Pair - It pairs super fast on my one plus. Whenever I have to pick call. I just pick the headset and wear them, meanwhile it makes sure that it connects to the phoneCons:1. Bass - It is very low for my music taste. I had adjusted the equalizer settings. Yet, I would say its not for someone who loves the heavy bass. Please stay away from this if you are oneOverall, a nice product. I often suspect when it claims that it's battery is charged 100% in just 25 mins. ;)3.\\n\", \"\\n  It's an amazing product from Oneplus.Pros:1. Lightening speed of pairing. You just have to separate both earphone from each other.2. The moment you again affix both earphones , power gets off for earphone. So no need to switch it on or off separately.3. Fitment of earphone with ear is very convenient.4. Long lasting battery.5. Warp charge gives 10 hrs back up with just 10 minutes charging. It's very useful feature.6. You can switch between two paired devices with single button.Con:1. Sound quality could have been better.2. The neckband could have been more rigid. Soft neckband like this one needs regular adjustment around neck.\\n\", \"\\n  Well, here I give true review about this ONEPLUS  WIRELESS BULLETS Z. Here i will say all pros and cons in my experience. So guys, i think if you read my full review it will help you before buying this OP Z.. Last month(August) i purchased this OP Z through amazon. After using one month i write this review.1.Unboxing:1st of all hats off to amazon for delivering this product within 2 days. Included 1 red C type cable, extra two pair of earplugs and manual. I received this new OP Z with Fully charged (100% charged)2. Experience:I lik this OP Z very much. It is very weightless and easily carried out wherever u go.Battery backup is amazing, it lasts up to 19hours and worth for continuous users. I think(but not sure) bluetooth range is 20feet.It comes with a magnetic attach, there is no on/off button if we separate that magnetic earpiece then earphone will be automatically ON and pair instantly within 3seconds and also this magnet have other features like play/pause songs (If magnet is attach song will be paused, and if separate it will not play in other mobiles but,friends told it works in oneplus mobiles ), attend/end the calls.It has  volume up/down and  song play/pause, call attend/reject button (center button) separately. When we increase/decrease the volume through earphones it doesn't work on our mobile(it works on oneplus mobile). Extra button is used for pairing two devices alternately it will help to pairing two devices.When this earphone is ON White light is blinking. While charging Red light is glowing and  white light is glowing when  fully charged.Mic is so cool and works perfectly. Audio quality is amazing and  very clear.Bass is not much good but not bad it is average so only i give 3 stars for this bass. But background music is crystal clear. But if we adjust bass in mobile it is better.3. Finally: Overall best product in this 2k range comparing to other products, becuase it is value for money and reliable too.Really i am a bass lover but i am satisfied with this product because of having many advantages in this OP Z and also one main reason is according to bluetooth devices, the bass feels little bit low comparing to wired earphones. I  like black,blue and oat colour. But i bought OAT COLOUR bcoz, i had Vivo V17 white colour mobile(here i attached photos). Yesterday again i bought one OP Z  black colour. Next week I will buy TWO MORE pair of earphones for my family members.Guys, i spend more time for writing this review. Hope all you satify with this review.\\n\", \"\\n  Was desperately waiting for this product since it was announced. And now that it is in my hands, I'm totally satisfied.Pros :- Amazing battery backup of 20 hours.- Less charging time. 10 hours of listening with just 10 minutes of charge. (with OnePlus warp charge)- Once paired, connects automatically in just under 2 seconds.- Sound from music & videos is loud and clear- Call quality is good.Cons :- Occasionally the buds fall from either ear. (but not really an issue)\\n\", '\\n  After a continuous usage of 2 months, the gadget is dead and not working at all!  And I have returned to my old Samsung Level U neckband (which was 3 year old and after purchasing the new one, I put the old one in my cupboard, thank god!).The One Plus Bullet Z was working good for the two months.  Battery back-up was also good since it works only when the magnetic earbuds detached from each other, and connectivity was also good,  But the length of the wire is the main drawback of the product.Anyway, there is no need to list out the pros and cons of this product, since most of the customers are facing the same problem I faced.  I will never recommend for a OnePlus product in the future!\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality is good at vocals but less in bass but it's okay battery life is awesome flexibility is very good build quality is very nice smooth and primium look light weight and very comfortable in use its charge in 15w charger charge 0-100%  in 45mins,18w charger charge 0-100% in 41mins,20w DASH charger charge 0-100% in 39mins\\n\", '\\n  One of the best earphone, value of money... better than others like realme and boat. Sound quality is much good and awesome bass quality but its looking ok ok, but not good for long term use, material quality is poor, it can be detected easily, we need to use  carefully\\n', \"\\n  Well I definitely suggest you to buy this earphone if you using OnePlus device and if can't afford to buy other OnePlus earphones like Bullet 1 & 2. With reducation in cost will make some reducation in performance too of this earphones too like Bass is compromised by OnePlus for providing bullet Z earphone at 2k cost. Thus, overall it is amazing product by OnePlus brand again.Pro*Quick charging with wrap charger in 30mins to Full charge and can easily survive two days without charging.*Magnet play & pause another mindblowing feature in the earphone.*Low latency feature performs good while playing PLUG*Good build quality.Con*Bass not high or good - averageAnd as per price - Worth paying for OnePlus users.\\n\", '\\n  After using it i can say its one of the best earphone flagship in the market.The best thing is its specificationsGeneral: In-ear audio. Weight: 28 g.Battery life: Up to 20 hours, 10 minutes charge for 10 hours of audio. Battery charge method: USB Type-C.Controls: Magnetic control. Button: Quick Switch, volume, skip track, phone calls, voice assistant.Surely go for it.Killer at 1999/-  Love it\\n', \"\\n  Horrible experience.1.I bought this for online office meetings. Its disconnected automatically so frequently .2.Sometimes voice breaking,intially i thought  its network issue but if i remove earphones no voice breaking.3.It has feature to attach to two different devices. But personally i didn't like this feature.because it did even ask me to pair to second device.as soon as any bluetooth on . it disconnect from my mobile and got attached to other devices which disturb alot in meeting.4.I returned this horrible oneplus Chinese item.\\n\", '\\n  Overall its terrificMain thing in this wireless era was a bettery ,till one plus come others were giving fast charge 10 min charging gives 60 min or 100 mins etc etc but wolla one plus shot them all with the single bullete(bullete z) and m sure and also had searched internet lot of time ,about the wireless thing gives amaizing battery ,previusly using jabra but now after one plus came i m just madly in love with them ,If ur normal users like me using ear phones for the music ,calls,gaming this is best u cant find alternative for thisBest things about this battery life it gives whole lot of battery in chargung for only 10 mins seriouslyThanks one plus this is my first purchase from one plus and its amaizing\\n', \"\\n  I loved it and was better than I expected. I was using a true wireless earbuds before this of Jbl and I must say Oneplus is better than that in every aspect. I am almost getting the feel of a wired earphones. Battery life is the main thing about it. With one charge, it can stay up to 1 and half day. If you have a fast charger, it charges within 1hr (am having a 18W fast charger of Samsung S9), if you have a faster charger it will charge more quickly like the 30W which you get with the Oneplus devices. You can use it for gaming also, but sometimes there is a lag in the sound like it takes a half a second to detect that sound. Also, I liked the way it can be turned on or off by the magnetic pull. Another thing is you can easily switch between devices by clicking the button twice (black button seen on the earphone), and that one works most of the time. You don't have disconnect from one device and then connect to another device, all you need to do is turn on the other device bluetooth and press the button twice present on the earphones. Overall it's a really good product, value for money, good sound quality and noise cancelation.\\n\", \"\\n  Based on the purchase experience1) Build quality is good2) Bass is low (I didn't expect from oneplus, they reduced according to price)3) Sound quality is good4) Bluetooth Connectivity is fast when you disconnect the magnet it connects instantly and it pause the player when to connect the magnet.5) Battery backup is superb when compared to others6) People who loves bass and it is not suitable.\\n\", \"\\n  Quality wise its ok but not that much value for that price Pro's:  1. Good Matty type build  2. Very fast to connect with paired device  3. Less weight  4. Easy to carry  5. Best battery backupCon's:  1. Looking wise build quality was nice but it's very delicate for this price range we can expect adjustable strip all basic type neckbands provide adjustable strips  2. It's is only connect at a time one device but 1200 range neck bands supports duel pairing.  3. For every time if you want to switch one device to another paired device we need to stop and start again  4. It took more time for connecting laptops  5. For this con's we can expect price should be 1200 but it's 2000  6. It's doesn't have vibration for call alert all basic neck bands have this feature.\\n\", '\\n  Sound quality good ,bass normal, magnetic play pause future supportingI m a 1+ user\\n', \"\\n  Pros:1. Battery life2. Features such magnetic earbuds to play or pause music3. PriceCons: (these are rather more important)1. Bass will be optimised only if you adjust sound enhancement on your phones (OnePlus)2. Sound clarity can certainly be betterAt this price point, you can't really compare these to other prominent earphones of the market.There are certainly a few compromises you need to make but of course there's bound to be a few trade-offs for the price you're paying for them.At around 2k, these are certainly one of the best wireless earphones.\\n\", '\\n  The sound quality is nice, although mic needs to adjusted sometimes. Not a bad product for the price range. Nice battery life(around 10 hours). Clear sound quality.The product is good but the first time around, the defective product was sent without a charging cable and when returned the product, the pickup guy kept on insisting about the same. I described the same and the defective sound quality was the reason for return. The pickup guy kept on arguing upon the same for approx 30 minute. I realised that it was my fault that I purchased from Amazon. My friend ordered the same product from one plus site and there were no issues regarding the service while exchange.So Amazon actually ruined my mood for the entire day. This was never expected from Amazon. Worst experience ever.\\n', \"\\n  The earphones are quite good. The noise cancellation is nice and the bass is deep. The setup was quick on my OnePlus 7, however i couldn't get it to connect to my Windows laptop. It just wouldn't appaer in the add bluetooth device section.Update after using them for a while:Straight to the performance part;These perform pretty good for casual music listening. The bass is good and punchy, it gets loud enough and the sound is crystal clear (almost always). However, when used on calls, they don't fare much better. There is no noise cancellation so the other person is able to hear a lot of ambient noise. And the call quality isn't as good as it is for music. The voice is muffled, which is very hard to understand. I found myself repeating whatever i said multiple times (almost always), The experience on calls isn't good at all, so much so that i stopped using it on phone calls.\\n\", \"\\n  Didn't expect this from OnePlus. If you are buying this to attend calls , forget it , it is complete QC failure where it is not tested for audio when on call. Strange robotic noise echoes when on call and the receiver does not hear anything. This happens only on call and no issue while hearing music.I ignored reviews and bought this, had to return this twice. I now understand, reviews matter !!!!I have tested with same phone, same network and same place where wired earphones has no issues.I hope this helps someone.\\n\", \"\\n  Okay here I'm writing the review after one day of use.1. Build quality is way too good in this price segment2. Battery backup is wild like I have been using it from last 12 hours and battery went from 100 to 60%And I have been using my warp charge and speed is tremendous I would say3. Call quality is also good other person could hear me clearly without any alteration with the sound quality4. Bass is not enough to satisfy your need with the Music if you are high end music lover than you won't find it worthy5. Coming to the point latency have to say I have been using this in my one plus 7T and it's ways too good no lag in sound quality I have faced so far.6. In terms of Comfort it's really good your ears won't pain or like you have anything out thereDisappointing that the cable for charging doesn't support fast dash charge or warp it's a simple cable for warp charge you need your ownPacking I found some flaw inside box doesn't come with never settle logo hope the product is genuineOverall this is the best in class Bluetooth headset under RS.2000You should go for it without hesitation\\n\", \"\\n  I have been using the headset for a month now. Following is the observation.Bought it for 2kGood1. It runs long.. I mean definitely more than 10 to 12 hrs.2. It recharges fully in about 40 mins (maybe).. but it was not 20 mins definitely. For me, that's quick enough.3. Can connect with only one device at a time. But, if you double press the button on the left side, you can connect to the previously connected device.4. The range is really good like they advertise is nearly 8-10 mts.. With my mobile, the range can cross 2 concrete walls (but barely).. but laptop, the sound through 2 walls is really clear.5. Earpieces have magnets, and If you join them... device goes into sleep mode.Not so great1. Sometimes the mic is not so great across distances.. it begins to crack.2. Conference calls in Webex, and calls on mobile were mostly good.. but faltered in Zoom, not sure where the problem is.. but in few zoom calls, there was no issue. Basically, people used to convey that voice is crackling, or hearing a ticking sound.3. The headset doesn't have a polished feel, keeps on twisting etc., feels flimsy, spineless (but not that bad). But has that rubbery feel.4. Doesn't have a left and right indicator letters on the ear pieces, though I felt it would have made my life easy.5. Connecting with devices was bit tricky.. since it doesn't have a dedicated on-off button.6. Commands like Ok Google didn't work :(7. Doesn't give voice commands, and you have to get used to the sounds it generates.Please note that my other headset is a boat rockerz 255. This is good in some areas (voice notifications, multiple device connection, voice commands), but lags in stamina (battery power) and range.\\n\", \"\\n  Build: Great.Battery: Not what's promised but lasts long enough for 2 days of use. Maybe around 12 to 15 hours on a full charge.Type C charging port is one of the main reason I bought these. Charges rapidly. You can definitely watch a movie with 10 minutes of charge.Sound: Not gonna talk about highs, mids and lows. For an average person, it sounds good. Don't expect audiophile level quality in this price range.Yes, it does sound a bit harsh sometimes and yes the bass is not gonna blow your mind but it's definitely worth the price.Passive noise cancellation is quite good, thanks to it's in-ear design.Misc: Bluetooth range is good. The low latency mode is only for OnePlus phones; I believe.Device switching is easy. You can pair it with 2 devices and switch between them by double pressing the 'quick switch' button.Comfort: It's so light that you'll forget that you are using it. However, like all the in ear headphones, it gets a bit uncomfortable if used for longer sessions.Overall, nice package.\\n\"], 'url': 'https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Bullets-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earphones/dp/B086CSGV2N/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&fst=as%3Aoff&pf_rd_i=6308595031&pf_rd_m=A1K21FY43GMZF8&pf_rd_p=2c2b4d9e-f15e-4cf3-8e5c-acf68c668c41&pf_rd_r=80WR7NYVY11014AWK7F7&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_t=101&qid=1601263641&refinements=p_85%3A10440599031&rnid=10440598031&rps=1&s=electronics&sr=1-6', 'category': 'Mobile', 'destination_urls': ['/Sony-WI-C200-Wireless-Neck-Band-Headphones/dp/B07S13PJ3W/ref=pd_sbs_353_1/260-2849167-3199729?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07S13PJ3W&pd_rd_r=ff38a1d7-8f44-4c79-9a3c-9a5efbf0763e&pd_rd_w=0w9vU&pd_rd_wg=0wkuR&pf_rd_p=00b53f5d-d1f8-4708-89df-2987ccce05ce&pf_rd_r=KN8CR0PYCS4HQ5QNBRC3&psc=1&refRID=KN8CR0PYCS4HQ5QNBRC3', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A046568211CV44DYKD044&qualifier=1602309066&id=1881881935875216&widgetName=sp_detail_thematic&url=%2Fdp%2FB01GGKYYT0%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB01GGKYYT0%26pd_rd_w%3DF2UBt%26pf_rd_p%3D719334a9-8cf4-4c2d-972b-46beedf42360%26pd_rd_wg%3D0wkuR%26pf_rd_r%3DKN8CR0PYCS4HQ5QNBRC3%26pd_rd_r%3Dff38a1d7-8f44-4c79-9a3c-9a5efbf0763e', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A02531242S20NAFJLPDON&qualifier=1602309066&id=5277930404111141&widgetName=sp_detail&url=%2Fdp%2FB07T81554H%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB07T81554H%26pd_rd_w%3D3Fkgl%26pf_rd_p%3D1801b34c-8af9-42b5-8961-11f124edc99b%26pd_rd_wg%3D0wkuR%26pf_rd_r%3DKN8CR0PYCS4HQ5QNBRC3%26pd_rd_r%3Dff38a1d7-8f44-4c79-9a3c-9a5efbf0763e', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A0789677KRMPAXGBRXRR&qualifier=1602309065&id=5640902399883895&widgetName=sp_detail2&url=%2Fdp%2FB08J3D1NKS%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1']}, {'_id': {'$oid': '5f815873aaa28c53dfe2b46e'}, 'description': 'Redmi 9 Prime (Matte Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Full HD+ Display & AI Quad Camera', 'price': '₹9,999', 'rating': '4.2 out of 5 stars', 'review_count': '173', 'reviews': ['\\n  The sale is scam.

Xioami claiming, made in India product but Amazon selling made in China product, when I purchased redmi 9A mobile and received made in China then I thought, may be by mistake but after one week, I ordered again redmi 9 prime but again received made in china product.

Must buy it before MI increases its price from Rs 9999 to Rs 10999.However, I'll recommend everyone to buy a 4GB Ram 64GB Variant as one has to pay Rs 2000 more for increasing only 64GB Storage to 128GB Storge and for Rs 11999 we have available Realme Nazro 10 with more Powerful Quad Camera along with 18W Fast Charger for which one has to Spnd more Rs 600 more to purchase separately for RedMi Prime Customer! Same difference also in Rear Camera also as Realme provides 16MP while RedMi 9 Prime only 8MP! It must be mentioned here that Camera Quality of RedMi 9 Prime is worth of Money if you buy 64GB Variant!In short, I'll recommend to everyone to buy this Smartphone before it's price hike as after increasing GST to 18% it has become just a Dream to buy a Smartphone with Powerful Battery back up, Powwrful Processor HelioP80, Quad Camera and Full HD Display!Thanks for reading my review!\\n\", '\\n  nice camera\\n', '\\n  Outstanding mobile...

Earlier i had participated in two flash sale but the phone was going out of stock in a few seconds.

Disgusting. Ratings are only 52 after 3 flash sales, that itself tells the story.If the stock went out just after it started and ratings are only 52, what sale is it making, keeping 10 units for each flash sale?There is no news on how many sales are made in each flash sale, that speaks for itself.\\n', '\\n  The best phone to buy under 10K Category, Back Panel is of Plastic Material, Glass or Metal would be very nice, battery drains a little fast, Sound Ok, Display Ok, Camera performance is also good, images are a little over-processed but looks good, No headphone inside the box Transparent back cover is present inside the box.\\n', \"\\n  During normal usage this phone gets heat up  upto 40 degree CelsiusAnd during charging it's charger heats very highAnd this phone's battery  last long only for 22 hours if we use for normal task only.Is that heating issue is common or it's a defective piece ?Update:- I got replacement of redmi 9 prime on 21 sep 2020 and this time product is perfectIt gives great backup of 1day 5 hours with heavy usage (i.e online classes, YouTube, unacademy etc)Phone doesn't heat but still charger heats\\n\", '\\n  Excellent phone i love it in this price\\n', \"\\n  The product is nice with great battery ,and the mostly insane killer looks.Camera is not as bad as everyone is sayingMeanwhile u can't expect more in this price rangeOverall best package in this price segment\\n\", \"\\n  Five stars for Full hd display, battery backup,fast chargerTwo stars for user interface, yellow page app with call application is huge privacy concerncan't forcestop annoying inbuilt waste app, forced MI apps over other apps\\n\", \"\\n  Redmi 9 Prime is a pretty compatible and good phone with great performance.

Xiaomi explains that this model has been launched because its Redmi Note 9 series has become more expensive due to the GST hike and Rupee-Dollar fluctuations. The Redmi 9 Prime is priced below the Redmi Note 9 series and starts just below the Rs. 10,000 price point. Has Xiaomi gone overboard with cost-cutting, or does the Redmi 9 Prime offer you good value for money? I review the new Redmi 9 Prime to find out.At the beginning of our Redmi 9 Prime review, we stated that the smartphone is a prime contender for the best smartphone under Rs 10,000 currently in India. Redmi 9 Prime is a budget all-rounder that ticks most boxes right with its value-for-money performance package.The camera unit may not be the best but it gets the job done. The lack of night mode is a bummer though. You can pick Xiaomi’s own Redmi Note 9 (review) that gets points for its big battery, decent display and an above-average performance unitI bought it for youtube review but it changed me\\n\", '\\n  good but not as advertised.camera is just ok\\n', '\\n  Money worthy deal .

Camera setting doesn't have any option for choosing the capture of pictures with fingerprint sensor. Earlier I was using redmi 7 which far good from redmi 9 prime the only advantage in 9 prime is ram and storage. Im disappointed with this little bit...

Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.● JBL  - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.Connector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●COMFORT :------------● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●LOUDNESS :-------------CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.●●  WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :---------------------------------------------I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :----------------------------------● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :PNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●CUSTOMER CARE :--------------------● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.● JBL : 1 Year warranty.

To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.Hope this review helps you make sound decision.\\n', '\\n  It worked fine for around 1.5 months and thereafter sound from one of the speaker became almost nil.Two more negatives1) Does not contain volume control2) Identifier to distinguish between left and right speaker is not easy to find and read on day to day basis\\n', \"\\n  I have used sony MDR-XB series earphones/headphones for a long time ..I have used XB-30EX, XB-55AP, XB-650BTI just got one issue in all the sony products that they don't last long more than a year.Even my XB650BT which costed me approx ₹6000 last october(2017), started giving me issues on its right speaker.So my openion on JBL C100SI is that YOU CAN DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT..!The reason for this is because u can't find any difference in SOUND QUALITY/BASS/SOUND CLEARITY between double/tripple time costing any other product than this JBL earphones.I am using this earphones for more than 4 months and they just sound like my old sony earphones but @ just half the price range.So i suggest you to choose wisely what you need.\\n\", \"\\n  After using the JBL in-ear headphones for about 10 month the product started showing problem in it's right earpiece.I am trying to connect to the JBL customer care but every time Amazon is providing a number which is not working. The toll free number are always busy of JBL customer service.So if anyone is interested in buying this earphone don't buy it because the after sale services are really bad and probably the worst compare to other earphone products.Lastly, if anyone know how to claim the product please kindly share it with me.\\n\", \"\\n  A reqular buyer on Amazon. But this time completely thugged. The description says Origin India. But have been delivered a Made in China Product. Unfortunately I discarded the box and bag and stuff so unable to return it.

I have purchased it from amazon #JBL C100SI is awesome sound effects than other earphone that I have already mention aboveI think it suits almost all mobilesBut some mobiles for best sound and beat we must  adjust equalizer then it produces awesome sound effectsFor both sound and bass .Don't think so..Go for this beast JBL C100SIAnd purchased just for 549 on sale..\\n\", \"\\n  I have been using this headphone extensively for last 4 months. I have found it durable and easy to use.It's sound quality is better than Boat 225, which was my previous earphones and a competitor of the JBL's one in this price range.

Sound quality is owsm,bass is gud, u can hear every single detail.But one thing i want to mention here dat if u r looking for d beat earphones in dis price range wid mic den go for it.And if u don't need a mic den go for Sennheiser CX180 .\\n\", \"\\n  Buying because 'JBL'? Well don't or you would regret it later.1 side stopped working, and going to the service centre 20 km away(okhla) only service centre in Delhi isn't worth it.But waste you money if you really want these 👍\\n\", \"\\n  I am writing this review after about 6 months of use as most earphones i purchased under Rs 1000/- never lasted for even half a year.Surprisingly these are still working well (*touchwood*) despite my rugged use.Pros:- Great external noise cancelation.- Good clarity while watching movies- Reasonably decent bass levels of the price. They wont let you down when the beat drops :P- Being an Audiophile whose working for brands like Yamaha, Jamo Dynaudio, mission amd many more these are the best for music to hear ever subtle note however I have to keep in my that I paid 599 for these on a lightning deal which makes the superb value for money while listening to music.- Gold plated connector pin for higher conductivity.- Clear microphone quality over call or while recording a vlog.- lightweight due to which they are not a burden on your ears and don't fall of your ears easily.- Cable spread adjustable lock built-in.Cons:- Gold plating on connector pin is slightly wearing of after 6 months.- There are better bass heavy earphones at this or lower price point. But this is very subjective to the genre of music you listen too. As to much bass kills the Mids & Highs. So you can call these headphones as balanced.Conclusion:Go for these if you're looking for a pair of branded earphone under 999/- with a microphone which will last you for a reasonable long time & have good quality balanced sound for movies and music.If you found this review useful make sure to hit the HELPFUL button under the review.  Happy shopping  Gills Guide.\\n\", \"\\n  Within one month left speaker not working. Waste of money.. Don't buy it\\n\", \"\\n  Superb product!! This is my 2nd time buying these earphones. Before these I purchased Sennheiser cx 180 street 2 but in just 3 months the sound quality dropped to minimum. Had to switch back to JBL.So here's the detailed review...Pros :1. Sound : Too great. Had to put my sound bar to half. Quality doesn't lessens even at the max sound. Bass is superb too.2. Built quality : marvelous built. One thing I like about JBL is that they make slight changes even if the launched model is way old. Built quality has been upgraded. Only thing I wanted was L shaped lead but it's fine.3.  Noise cancellation : great noise cancellation. You can totally rely on this. Once you put on everything will seem great about it.4. Ear comfort : fits too well. You won't need to adjust them once you've put them on.Cons : apart from the normal shaped lead I didn't found any cons about it. It will last for more than an year and can even work for more than 2 years if handled carefully.Hope this will help you decide.Have a nice day!!\\n\", '\\n  I have used a variety of earphones like boat, soundmagic, Panasonic, Sony, Flipkart smartbuy and few more. This earphone from JBL the c100si has clear sound and decent base.Cons1. packaging is very average and the seal sucks because it can be easily tampered and yet go unnoticed.2. Bass loudness is average at best but is very clear though. this is definitely not for bass lovers. Its adequate but its not punchy like boat or Panasonic.3. Treble is a bit high at times and may get irritating4. No angled 3.5mm Jack, might be an issue for some.Pros1. Excellent clarity all over the frequency range2. Decent build quality, looks like it will last for a year3. Mic is good enough for calling purpose.Overall a decent product from a well known brand at an affordable price.\\n', '\\n  I will start with my personal experience, i used almost all the earphone product mostly which is branded and known in market.

Bass is very low..and 1 ear tip is missing...i want to return this but no optionfor it. Guys dont waste your money for this crap.\\n', '\\n  Better than boat 225 caz it does not loose easily from ur ear. No meaning of sound if u not comfortable with headphone.I was suffering huge problem with boat 225 when it looses from my ear during normal walking. but it sound is too loudy .C100si is low but has crystal clear sound. Also it fits easily in ear.I am listening songs mostly at night while sleeping but u can not sleep facing your ear to pillow causing some irritation with C100si.And with boat 225 It is anyhow not possible caz it has pole like length of lid and u feel pain.I wanted to buy Sennheiser caz it is more good in respect of comfortablity but due to absence of mic ( which is necessary in PUBG) I forcefully buy C100si.\\n', '\\n  I Bought this headphone for one of my friend and she is very happy with its AMAZING sound quality.:)It a better choice to gift this product to your music lover friends.Go for it..\\n', \"\\n  This is a solid earphone. Although I don't like the sound quality over Sennheiser cx180. But since it has mic and I wanted to play PUBG mobile so I am satisfied with it.Second thing I don't like about it is the design of earbuds. They are always falling out of my ears. I had to replace the ones with a pair from Samsung.Third, the cable is not durable. I must clarify that I use earphones extensively with my smartphone. The cable of this earphone is broken from the joint near headphone jack. Even though it's been barely six months.I am not satisfied with this.\\n\", '\\n  Firstly,I would thank Amazon for their timely and hazzle free delivery.Comming to the earphones, I am using them since last 1-2 months and the overall experience is just what I expect from a JBL earphone worth Rs. 800. Sound quality, material quality and durability is perfectly what I had hoped for. They come with a mic so that is an advantage which makes them a complete package earphone to buy in this price range. I believe most of you know JBL is a brand and hence it goes without saying that it would offer the best in class products. So its a very wise option to buy in this prize range.\\n', '\\n  JBL has only 7 Service Centers in India....!! Earphone is not working right now so I have to travel from Pune to Mumbai to replacement ??  Check the service center list before buying any JBL product.... Worst customer care experience ever...!! took me more than 30 min. to connect with customer care....!!\\n', \"\\n  Pros:-1.Excellent noise cancellation for this price range. And if the music is on, you won't be able to listen majority of things going on outside. Even in great traffic, it cuts the noise to half of the original intensity without any music. With music,it cuts off the noise upto 97%.2.Sound is perfectly balanced.It was a great experience to listen to all the genres with it.I had absolutely no problem with it. It's been a year now since I am using them and they are still perfect man!👌👌👌3. Mike is located at the perfect spot and has a good power if catching sound. The mike button also works pretty well.4. Have recommended it to all my friends and they loved it too.Con:-This may be only in my case. Because my ears are the smallest ears to be found(according to my family and friends)😄😄😄 and only the smallest size of ear buds fit in my ears. And I didn't get the smallest size of earbuds with this earphone.So, had to arrange it from outside.That's not a big issue as it seems. But lemme tell you, if the earbuds are not fitting perfectly inside, then, audio experience and the noise cancellation property, all goes in vain because your earphones would be falling out of your ear every now and then which is very irritating.2. And being from a middle class household, Honestly it was a bit costly for me🙄...but i saved money and purchased it.No regrets for that. It's awesome.But to prevent any damage to it,I covered it up with  cover(spiral wires).Otherwise, no problem at all. It's the perfect earphone in this price range👌Totally happy😊\\n\", '\\n  I was used it for 5-6 Days.Their are 2 outputs based on my experience.1. When used it Slightly Loose in ear :- i felt Treble/Vocals was so high an no base either you listen music or on call.During calls over night (2hrs) use my family member were easily able to listen what other person speaking on call.after use it make me deaf for shorter time and whole night and next day it cause me headache.2. When used  fit in ear.You feel high base still Treble are here, I felt it that my ear drums was poping.I listened music continue for 30 mintus using YouTube, Goolge Music , Mi music, different Phone but result was same. When i removed it from ear it cause deafness for some time and drowsiness and pain in earOver call still high vocalsSame result for Si200 model but base is lacking and clear audio\\n', \"\\n  Headphone review1. Packaging good2. Made of premium quality plastic3. Very comfortable no pain in ears after using it for 2 hours4. Noise reduction is very good5. Bass is little less but trebble is quite good and very balanced voice.6. Very good branding.7. Mic availableBad thing is wires are not tangled free and JBL should provide a pouch to carry.Otherwise better than Skullcandy and Mi basic earphone. If you don't need mic go to Sennheiser.Overall satisfied with the product...!!\\n\", \"\\n  After using this with SONY MDR-EX150AP and CX180.Sound qulity: cx180 lil bit driven by clarity, jbl lil bit driven by base, prefer sony because it has right proportion of base and clarity.Mic: cx180 doesn't have mic others two have.Durability: cx180 don't even last 3 months. One side stopped working, though I had repaired I was not satisfied with the durability. Sony and jbl are still working fine. Will have to see, both seems durable.Comfort: Normal use SONY feels more snuggly and comfortable. JBL comes out often while you are using(I tried changing the bud with lil bigger one but it feels uncomfortable, I'm using with spare bud that's included with my sony headphone and now feels ok). CX 180 fits and feels well but not upto the mark of SONY but while sleeping CX180 is more comfortable because of its less protruding design.***JBL- Other nearby people can easily hear what you are listening (slightly better when used with sony buds)Price: JBL wins.So you decide.Update:JBL stopped working both sides after 10months.\\n\", '\\n  Perfect birthday gift to music lover.Sound quality are awesome.

Packing is good.2. wire is delicate, which may get teared soon.3. not having \" L \" shaped connector, due to this many times earphones get disconnected while keeping in pocket.4. Will be good only for music tat to with less bass sound .5. No option to receive the call in headphone, even if we receive manually the sound is low.6. After successfully using for year, i put it to dustbin as only right side headphone worked.Suggested product: boAt BassHeads 225\\n', '\\n  Good product for the price. Good sound quality, enough bass and not so harsh top end. Seems durable too. Highly recommended for rough usage. Plus, it has a mic and a button for play/pause. Would definitely buy one more if current one stops working.\\n', \"\\n  Totally disappointed by the quality of earphone. It did not even stand for one year. One of the earpiece is not working.And above all that they have worst service centre in Hyderabad. I don't understand how can they tied up with a service centre (Sri Sai communication)  which has got so many bad reviews, don't they are worried about their reputation. I lost my money. I had a high expectations from JBl and Amazon.\\n\", \"\\n  I am actually this product (earphones) continuously for 20 hours a day (be it listening to music, or talking) and I am fully satisfied the quality of sound it is providing. Actually the best one can have in this price range. Even in crowded place or wherever I go, it provides me full satisfactory audio quality, and smooth experience. It fits into the ear so finely (and light weight) that I didn't have to bother about it or put it off while I am in bike or cycle. So, basically, it is worthy my money and I am writing this as a satisfied customer of this product. Thank you Amazon.\\n\", '\\n  Earphones are good.  I got it by an offer costing me worth Rs549. Bass is good but not great.  As you increase the volume,  you will feel treble taking over the bass.  The earbuds fit perfect. Got 2 extra earbuds set as per ear size. Material is good.  The length is more than sufficient. I am happy with the product as i got it in less money and its performing great at this price. If you want this to work even better,  then use bass booster app. You will feel real bass then.  After installing the app,  bass is far improved and treble issues are also eliminated.\\n', \"\\n  One of the best earphones to have in the budget segment. I've used a lot of earphones and I personally felt that these are a complete all rounder.The bass may seem a bit letdown, but a bit of boosting and tuning from your phone's app will surely help.Perfect for use as daily drivers.Ample of punch, clear vocals, good treble, okayish bass, great noise cancellation considering the price point and it comes with a mic!A must buy if you're looking for a good pair of earphones in budget.\\n\", '\\n  No noice-reduction feature, this makes it useless for talking on call.While talking on phone, my actual voice going to the other end is very little, instead the other end can perfectly hear my surronding disturbance. I have to hold the mic and keep it very close to mouth in order to let other person hear my voice. But my wife talking on phone in background can be perfectly heard by the other person on call.\\n', '\\n  Just brought it, & compare it to my Sennheiser CX 180, I used Sennheiser cx180 for approx 4 years, one is damaged so i purchase same another one.This review contain a comparison between both. Also i share pros & cons.JBLPros1. IT HAS MORE BASS AS COMPARES TO CX1802. VOLUME IS ALSO LOUDER.3. IT HAS A MIC WHICH IS VERY USEFUL & THIS IS THE MAIN REASON I BUY IT.CONS.1. IT HAS MORE BASS BUT SOUND IS NOT CLEAR, ON CX180 YOU WILL LISTEN ALL BEATS MUSIC CLEARLY.2. WIRE BUILD QUALITY IS VERY POOR. MI BASIC WHICH IS APPROX AT RS 350 IS MORE DURABLE THAN THIS.3. EAR CUSIONS ARE ALSO NOT SOFT, IT HURTS MY EAR AFTER A SHORT USE.4. AFTER USING THESE FOR APPROX 1 HRS, MY HEAD WAS STARTS TO PAIN.SO FOR RS 700 RANGE SENNHEISER IS PREFECT & BALANCED EARPHONES WITHOUT A MIC.\\n', \"\\n  Overall judgement:Audio quality: 3/5Bass: 2.5/5Built quality: 2/5Mic quality: 3/5Cable quality and durability: 3/5Comfort and ease of use:1.5/5The whole ear phone is made of plastic. Durability is not that good. Sound quality is not up to mark. Could have been a hell lot better. Not a good option for bass lovers (ideal choice would be Sony MDR XB55AP). Although for regular use it may be okay for some customers. Cable gets tangled frequently as this earphone doesn't come with a flat cable. The most disappointing factor is that it does not fit well inside your ears. It's quite uncomfortable and feels like taking out of our ears just after 10 mins of usage. Mic quality is okay but not that good. The person on the other side would not be able to hear you loud and clear most of the time even if you are indoors.\\n\", \"\\n  It's a good product. The sound quality and build quality is amazing for just 1299. Wait for amazing offers. I got it at 699 (46%). Just buy it, don't read the reviews that regard that the product is bad. I think that this earphones are the best budget earphones. Even many big tech youtubers tell that these earphones are good.\\n\", \"\\n  Well it's brand is popular, but it too has pros and cons:-Pros---*Crisp sound quality*Mic is excellent like mics of Samsung*No distortion even at 90-100 volume*Enough loudness*Noise cancellation is good at that priceCons---*Bass is not up to the mark treble is relatively high*Wire is also average gets tangled, but is manageable*No clipsThat's all thanks for reading, tag it helpful if you liked.\\n\", '\\n  I got them for around 600 and i think the price is completely justified.You get a 1 year warranty and JBL will always be upto the mark when it comes to the service.The sound quality is good, you get 3 size of ear buds, which helps when u loose one the end.They have worked fine for 9 months then, i went to the service centre and they replace the same.The earphones are perfect and they wont dissatisfy you at any time\\n', '\\n  I bought this in Jan 2017.. Now one side sound not working, I have to claim warranty... How to repair my headphone..\\n', '\\n  Jbl C100SI is one those rare earphones which stands right in my demand.Using this earphones for more than 3 years still working perfectly so if you are looking to buy earphones for urself so i am going to share Pros & Cons According to me -PROS -1) Good Highs & Lows.2) Noise cancellation to an extent.3) equipped with bass.4) Excellent In line microphone.5) extra ear cups of small, medium,large.CONS -1) Light wire quality.2) Tangled wire.3) Less Wire Length.So, if u are planning to buy earphones you will happy because it also works very good while playing online games using this earphones.So from my side its a go go ..👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻I hope you like my review of you have any questions do ask i will be more than happy to give answers.ThankYou...\\n', \"\\n  Writing this review after using these earphones about 6months. First lets talk about its pros-1. Best noise isolation in this price. As these goes really inside your ears due angled design.2. Good bass.3. Very good quality mic. And mic is at really close to mouth on right earbud. So you don't need to hold it to your mouth while calling. Also their is a button on mic whivh can be used to control music and receive/end the calls.4. Good Loudness.Now the cons for which i have given them three stars-1. Treble is really high. And you can't listen them to full volume.2. In some songs these gets very harsh u can't listen these even at 80% volume.3. Not recommended for longer listening beacuse of harsh sound and also as these goes deep in your ears, so you will pain after some time.4. Build quality is not that great.5. No volume control given on these only one button.Conclusion:-  I think these are ok earphones considering the price. These have good bass.If you increase your budget little bit you can buy one more piston fit earphones which have better sound quality and treble and bass is balanced but little less bass. Jbl c100si has high bass and high treble and better noise isolation.Also jbl c100si and c200si are both same there is no difference just name is changed are also price is high.......Update:Left earphone stopped working....lasted 1 year and 4 months , which I think is good considering my usage. I carried them in my pocket daily..\\n\", \"\\n  I bought it during the discount session at ₹599 and at that price it's really good the audio is clear and crisp only thing i don't like is the bass it was somehow a hidden miss but there they are and you can use third party music players to control it .Bus as of right now at pirce of ₹799 i think it's just a little pricy\\n\", \"\\n  Past few months I didn't have good sound output so I wasn't listening to music as much as I used to, at one point I thought why am I not listening music. But I discovered why after trying these, because the music quality is not good on my phone and speakers, I used to have in ear headphones which got damaged so I started listening on speakers which are not that good now. I can't stop listening to music now.. Can't believe these are just 650inr, my last pair from a different brand was 2k. Hope these will last build quality looks good. Also not so much pain with the rubbers, hoping that it won't be issue in future, as of now I'm happy with the money spent. Bass is decent.\\n\", \"\\n  If you are looking for a good earphone in this price range, this is one option worth considering. Its been a month since I started using these and I'm satisfied as of now.So the first look of the product wasn't great, it looks like some fake Chinese earphones. But once plugged in, it's a beast. So performance wise, this is one of the best you will find in the range. Now it depends on your preference what you want to value more. A quick Summary:Bass: 9/10Treble: 9/10Vocals: 8/10Outside Noise Reduction: 8/10Microphone quality: 9/10Comfort: 9/10Build Quality: 8/10Looks: 7/10Overall Performance: 9/10Overall appearance: 7.5/10Decision: Your call what you value more. Appearance wise, you may find better looking earphones in the price range. But if you re indifferent to how they look and focus is more on performance, then these are on of the best you will find.P.S.: They entangle like any other earphone. No innovation on this end. :)\\n\", \"\\n  I have bought boat 225 which I'm not satisfied at all.But for a 100 bucks  u get this head set which is way better in everything like QUALITY, COMFORT and WEIGHT LESS. If you want to buy headset in 500 to 600 range this is best .I ratequality -- boat 225 - 2 🌟 and JBL 4 🌟Comfort -- boat 225 - 0 🌟 ( I want to give negative as it so unless comfortable and slippery) and JBL 5 🌟 Weight -- boat 225 - 2 🌟 and JBL 5 🌟\\n\", \"\\n  Pros:The earphones are light and compact.Sturdy and good built quality.Sound is crisp and loud.Equalizer response is next level.Cons:Missing the L shared Jack holder.Bass could have been more deep.Bass - 8/10Mids - 8/10High - 9/10Overall well balanced earphones at this price range.Definitely an amazing sound experience from JBL.I'd definitely recommend these earphones under 1k\\n\", \"\\n  Well , I received it the next day which is wonderful.Nice packaging and all but the product..It feels good. It looks but it doesn't work good.The sound quality is average , when I tried different equalizers through my phone or pc I couldn't find any difference between this ₹600 earphones and free Samsung earphones.The fitting it nice and easy and comfy but the sound the bass are disappointing.I prefer to raise your budget and buy sennheiser products. They will always amaze you\\n\", \"\\n  Why its written ' country of manufacturer china 'Jbl harman is from south korea. When i saw this product on app it was written like manufactured by harman jbl but when i received it there was made in china written clearly so how ?Made in china ??? How jbl become made in china?\\n\", \"\\n  Warranty of 12 months. Broke just after 13 months. Bad luck. Had ordered Sennheiser and SkullCandy in the same range earlier and they had longer warranty and were replaces by the company twice (just had to mail it to them via post, less than Rs.50). Didn't get a chance for this to get fixed.Good quality sound at this price. Don't expect it to last long, if you want it to last long apply tape or feviquick near the joints. They start to come apart pretty quickly.Actual Music Lovers and just Base heads, keep reading:Order IEMs from AliExpress when you get a chance. A good starting one is KZ ZSN Pro for about Rs.1500(Just mentioning because I have it, don't buy this, by CCA C10}.There is also KZ ZS3 around Rs.800 for starters and the best one is CCA CC10 for Rs.1600.These are the best built earphones and there is literally no comparision with more expensive earphones in India.The only better headphone is Sony's XDR.\\n\", '\\n  I am here with a comparison to boat100(my old earphone) to JBL100PlugBoat : It has a good quality silver plated plug.JBL: It has a golden plated plug but the design seems to be vulnerable. May cause disconnection if bend carelessly.Chord wireBoat: very strong high quality thick wire which can last for longJBL: very thin , light weight structure which I think will not have long life.It got cut within a week.worst.MicBoat: it\\'s little longer with good material quality.JBL: small low quality, light weight material but the function seems to be good.It has got small clip to stop the unwanted movement of mic.HeadphoneBoat: The design seems to be special and overall good.JBL: Standard design with a better fit.Sound qualityBoat: Good sound quality.JBL: Good sound quality with more bass.WarrantyBoat: warranty is thereJBL: No warranty. Just throw away if damaged.Verdict: With almost same sound quality, Boat seems to be having the upperhand according to me due to the built material quality. In JBL,The chord wire, mic and the plug neck seems to be vulnerable. And there is a \"made in China\" sticker in JBL too(If you are bothered about the make).The cost of JBLCS100 is more than even Boat225, so you can even go for that.\\n', \"\\n  I bought it at 700₹. The sound is topclass. Noice cancellation is also very decent. I give it a 5/5.but in terms of build quality I will give it 3/5.I rated the earphone 3 star because I believe just like other earphones it will die soon after the warranty ends. If it doesn't then I will give it a 5 star.So if you are thinking of buying it have no doubt this is an awesome earphonePros:1) Awesome sound quality. Can hear the sound distinct and clear unlike other earphones which focus on being bass savy which is very annoying destroys the original music quality.2)The mic is also decent.Cons:1)The wires are so thin it feels like it might break if you are not careful while putting it or taking it out of your pocket.2)The wires aren't tangle free.So I will wait for a year and if it does disappoint me I will 5 star it.\\n\", \"\\n  After about a month of usage, I can safely say that this product isn't the best buy at this price range.Cons:1. The wires are too sticky and just mess up all the time.2. Due to it's shape, it gets uncomfortable to sleep while wearing these. It shouldn't really happen.3. The mic is too close to the ear.4. The 3.5mm jack is not angled which causes difficulty when using it with laptopsAlthough the sound quality is quite good, I really don't like the build quality. I suggest buying some other earphones with better build quality in the similar price range.\\n\", '\\n  This product is far better than what I expected for from my previous JBL purchase. Product works really amazingly with good overall bass.If your are looking for high bass this is not something I will buy.For an average users for superior product quality and sound quality this is the one you should go for ...I love my product only have a small fear on 1 year product replacement warranty if the product has any manufacturing defects as to how Amazon will accomplish the same ...Thank you\\n', '\\n  - Material used is okay but Boat bassheads wire quality n bud quality looks better than this comparing both are almost of same price.- There is too much treble, i usually use an apps inhrrent Equilizer to reduce the last bar for treblr.lil down from usual in middle.- Bass is unbelievable at this cost..pretty bang on- Sound clarity is amazing, very clear.- Call quality from my OnePlus 5T using this earbuds is pretty good and clear, no disturbances.All in all this earphone is much better compared to its closest competitor earphones like Boat bassheads, Sony, Panasonic, House of Marley etc.I used to use 3000 Rs. Sony XBR in ear headphones but i realised this has better quality sound with nice bass with 1/5th the cost.\\n', '\\n  Been using for more than a year now.And I am a harsh user.I Travel to college via bus filled with a lot of people and I tend to wrinkle the earphones and insert it in my jeans pocket and throw them in my bag.I also listene to music while sleeping and they tend to wrinkle and jam between me and bed.Though after this much harsh use you can see *tears on wire* but they works really good.I would suggest you guys not to buy ₹50 earphones from railway station once every month instead buy this beast.1 value for money2 long lasting (after more than 1 Yr use)3 Good so d quality (Bass not gr8 btw)And Red in colour 😍Farewell JBL headphones. After tortures from me you can Rest in peace now. (Gonna buy new ones)\\n', '\\n  This earphones comes in the league of Sennheiser and Soundmagic as far as sound quality is concerned! Sound quality is very similar to those company earphones! However the frequency response is only between 20hz-20khz so deep base is absent(should be lower than 20hz). The depth in sound is also not present unlike soundmagic earphones which have depth! The biggest issue with these earphones is that it is very uncomfortable! Due to the size and shape of the earphone it occupies the ear fully and puts pressure on it, so many of you will feel uncomfortable using it(unless you have bug ears and ear opening!). Buy it if only if you are on a budget, want good sound quality and have big ears!\\n', '\\n  Alright, it\\'s a little early to write this Review but I liked the product so much in the very first trial that I couldn\\'t help myself.The earphones came in good packaging and as soon as I unboxed them and put them on, they were so comfortable that I fell in love instantly.Then, to check the sound I played Iron Maiden\\'s \"Different World\" and man, oh man! The experience was amazing.Bass is amazing and it doesn\\'t get shrill even in the maximum volume.Let\\'s see how\\'s my overall experience going to be.\\n', '\\n  Really Happy with Appario Retail Private Limited Quick Prompt Service.Order Placed on 05th January, 2020 Delivered on 06th January, 2020 at 14:00 hrs. Received in Excellent Condition, Safely Packed, Product Same As Shown On Display. Along with JBL C100SI In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black) Received 2 Extra Pair of Ear Buds. Tried on my SamsungGalaxy M30S, No Problem whatsoever, Clear Crystal Sound & Listening. Go 4 It, Worth A Buy. Buy Hands Down.\\n', \"\\n  While I received the product it looks like original one but after listening songs checking bass and frequency range, it is not meeting any expectations as mentioned by product.So don't buy it online as they are giving you huge discount because it is fake product...Save yourself.\\n\", \"\\n  These earphones have excellent sound quality. Well balanced bass and treble. But the material used is not that impressive. It surely looks and feels like a cheap earphone.  JBL should have provided flat tangle free wire. Even some cheaper earphones have that. I use both this and Antaudio W56. The build quality on W56 is just superior in build and looks killer and has great sound quality. W56 has more bass than JBL c100si. But c100si has clear trebles. I use W56 for daily use. Overall if someone is looking for great build quality, bass and clear sound then definitely check out Antaudio W56. You won't be disappointed. It is priced lower than JBL c100si and for that you get excellent build and superb sound.\\n\", \"\\n  Surprised to see 'JBL' and 'Amazon' selling defective products, left side was not working, waiting for the replacement and will update the comment accordingly.I expect a basic QC check before the delivery and surprising part is there was no refund option, this product was 'Amazon's choice' and still it came defective, looks like all the rejects are getting dumped without a process in place.\\n\", \"\\n  The earphones in itself are nice but they do not support surround noise cancellation in microphone. Also the microphone itself sometimes has issues as it muffles one's own voice. Other than that, the sound quality is pure magic, have been using them from past 6 months and the quality is without a doubt far better than it's competitors. Would recommend it if you like bass.\\n\", \"\\n  Do not buy.. as per 800 Rs. I'm un satisfied with sound Quality.I had already used nokia 5235-6233 in pastAlso used letv cdla eqrpjone worth rs 1200.All those were best comared with this.In this earphone No bass. Although irritating and make pain in ear.Dont buy any rubber earphone.One more thing i had baught by sewing review on YouTube but.. dont trust on YouTubeer.. all the milions of subscribers youtibers are fake.. i got wrong product .I suggest in earphone just go to showroom.. test it and than buy it.\\n\", \"\\n  BUT...>>>>>Let’s know about its DURABILITY according to me when using this daily with care. So according to me this product is not durable at all in terms of its poor quality rubber material based CABLE which usually always tends to get tangled and wears out really fast when kept in a bag or a pouch and hence as time goes by it leads to affecting its performance in many ways in the long run and so my review is based on one of the major issues that i faced and so this is how it started..........So first of all AMAZON is not at all blamed for the fault of this product as they packaged it well and delivered it on time before the expected delivery date and i am completely satisfied with AMAZON & it’s SERVICES!!!!!And so it’s the company that did not design this product to last for more than a year or less than that!!!!!!!!Anyway I Bought this product on Amazon in the MONTH of OCTOBER in the YEAR 2019 and everything went smooth after opening the package as I enjoyed this pair of earphones so much so that I did not realize that it's cable design, durability and built quality was really poor and hence I kept on using it and it never failed on me and always worked well but all of a sudden in the MONTH of MARCH in the YEAR 2020 which is two months from when i posted my review about this product, i had a major issue and it was that the right earphone all of a sudden stopped working out of nowhere while listening to music one day and later it was discovered by me that it would only work if I keep moving the top cable of the right earphone which is attached the 1 Button Remote With The Microphone and so it would start working and stop working as soon as I let go of the cable and this means that there was some loose connection between the  Button Remote and the cable which should not happen as it cost a lot of money and jBL is well known company and they have outstanding products with fairly good prices compared to BOSE which is better but really highly overpriced. So currently I will call jBL CUSTOMER CARE and ask them to resolve the issue by either repairing my earphones or if not repairable that replace it with a new one as its still under its WARRANTY PERIOD!!!!! So I will put an update as soon as I’m done solving my issue!!!!!FINAL VERDICT: IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET WHICH IS BELOW RS 600/- or BELOW RS 700/-THEN!!!!!AND ONCE AGAIN ONLY THEN!!!!! GO FOR THIS PRODUCT AS IT’S A GREAT PAIR OF EARPHONES UNDER YOUR BUDGET AT A HUGE DISCOUNTED PRICE!!!!!BUT IF YOU BUDGET IS BELOW RS 1000/- AND YOU LOVE jBL SIGNATURE SOUND THEN GO FOR THE ONES THAT HAVE THE TANGLE FREE CABLE AS THEY WILL DEFINITELY LAST LONGER AS IN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND NOT GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE BUT OBVIOUSLY IF YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT :)AND SO GUYS I WOULD RECOMMEND WHENEVER YOU PURCHASE ANY PAIR OF EARPHONES OF ANY KIND OF COMPANY PLEASE DO BUY THE ONES WITH THE TANGLE-FREE CABLE AS I HAVE A PAIR of HEADPHONES WITH A TANGLE-FREE CABLE AND IT HAS BEEN NEARLY 3 YEARS BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED TO IT AT ALL AND IT STILL WORKS WELL.SO GO AND GET SOME GOOD PAIR OF EARPHONES if needed AT A VERY GOOD PRICE ON Amazon.inAS THEY USUALLY PROVIDE GOOD AFTER SALE SERVICES ACCORDING TO ME!!!!!!!!!!Thanks  to all of you who read and understand my review.And finally please do comment if you want to do so and if you find this review helpful please hit or click that “Helpful”.\\n\", \"\\n  I really like the quality of the sound which a user experience through these earphone. Best in it's category.\\n\", \"\\n  It has a microphone button, which can be used to pause/resume music as well.No fast-forward or rewind buttons though.The music quality is great for listening to videos or music.While running, the headphone doesn't come off, so that's a plus.It is well designed and fits my ears properly.Personally I haven't used the microphone a lot, it appears to be good though. People can't hear you if you are driving on bike though, due to the wind disturbance.I definitely recommend this product. It is worth it\\n\", \"\\n  Just received these headphones.There is NO BASS in these headphones. Terrible for Music!If you require a JBL headphone for calling purpose then maybe, but for music, it's a definite NO!There's also no return policy for this product, only replacement, which is of no use to me now. Waste of money!\\n\", '\\n  After reading all the negative feedback regarding 1 ear stops working after some time and after sales i was bit hesitant to purchase this product.. But considering the brand name of JBL and Amazon i thot to give it a try.. And now here i am with a faulty earphones.. Left one stopped working after 11 months of use and there is no after sales service.. I even tried opening up the left earphone hoping if it is something to do with broken wire or connections i can try to fix.. But the wire and connections was intact.. Its the poor quality of speakers that they are using in this product..Really disappointed..\\n', '\\n  ordered this a couple of months back. Having tried Sennheiser, sony , skullcandy and other similar products i would say given the price point at which these guys are selling, these headphones are pretty good.. a little bass heavy ,for people who like the extra punch, treble gets a little washed out with those bass heavy EDM tracks but overall a really nice product. And the mic is the icing on the cake man. Kudos to Amazon for their on point delivery and nice packaging.P.S  if you could really manage to shell out a few hundred bucks more i would say go for the sennheiser mx180.\\n', '\\n  I have been using many types of Earphones since past several years. I moved to BlueTooth. More expensive. Different Brands. I tried many and got a big hole in my pocket simultaneously.And One Day, I found myself surrounded with all broken, non working or semi functioning headphone/earphones. They all were Useless even spending that much money on them. It was really HeartBroken to found all worthless items after spending so much of my hard earned money.Then, I found this one. Simple and Easy. Minimal. Cheap and Easy. And it is still working giving the full return of the money spend.\\n', '\\n  My main requirement is Microphone.  My expectation is when I speak , the voice clarity should be Nice... But I notice you have to hold the Mic close to mouth , for voice to be clearly audible to others in meetings on computer.When it just hangs , the Mic picks up very low voice.  So every time I am on a call, I have to keep holding Mic close to mouth , at least in modern designs they should have addressed this issue.The Earbuds are OK... Sound in the Ears is fine...  Average Quality. Comfort level in the Ear is not the Best, but Ok, not great, but Ok. You get what u pay for.I wish the wires were a little more Tangle-Free.\\n', \"\\n  Ok so let's talk about it's sound quality..it's sound quality is Damm good it beat all the earphones up to the price range 1500. It's bass is awesome and beats also provide very smooth sound quality. Don't go it's higher model c200si because they both are same in delivering sound. The quality of wire is also good for the price range 700 and u all know it is JBL. The only one cons is music control buttons, this is missing but overall it is good earphones  u should go for it...they are far better then latest one plus type c bullet earphones which is around 1500.  For comparison between one plus and this JBL earphones refer the YouTube channel geekyranjit.\\n\", '\\n  I have been using these earphones since 3 months. Suddenly right ear phone stopped working. As per Amazon this product is uder 1 year warranty. But JBL is saying they are not the manufacturer of this product. There is a section at the end of the product page saying this is a product of 3g gold star and does not have any warranty. I donno why Amazon is promoting such products. Legal action has to be taken by JBL for falsly using JBL label on some Chinese products\\n', \"\\n  This is a really very cheap and worst product by Jbl.Sound quality is really annoying and poor. I must say roadside earphones are much better than this.I got stuck after buying it as Amazon's policy is just replacement and not refunding so can't help now, but for new buyer I'll say go for some other branding like sony or boat where you will get quality product for sure.Ear fit is good but need good sound also with it.\\n\", '\\n  I have been using this for about a week now, and it is already not working at times.  A heavy object was placed over the product, I agree, but I am sure any product has to be sturdy enough to withstand some pressure.  I have to throw this away in another month or so because the quality of the wire is so thin that even a minor mishandling of the wire will mean you are losing the entire money spent on the product.After purchasing cheap earphones for many many years, I decided to buy a branded product. I feel this is not worth it, buy an inexpensive product, comes under your computer, throw it away and buy the next one if you want to buy a product and treat it like a reincarnation of god because it is so feeble in quality is not my cup of tea.\\n', \"\\n  Material quality - worst I have seen.Sound quality - its average.Durability - when I received the product it looks so frazile that i was even afraid to even test it.Suggestion - its almost beggar beliefs that JBL even manufacture such product and when not on sale they are selling it at 800 rupees. Honest opinion, you can spend same amount of money in amazon and buy something with better built quality. I'm replacing ing this item with boat or leaf headphones.\\n\", '\\n  Well, given the price they are charging it is expected that the sound quality will be good. I don’t have any complaints there.However, these are earphones, meant to be connected to a cellphone which is expected to spend sometime in pant pockets. If the wires are flimsy then the pressure of pocket damages the conducting wires or junctions of the earphones. When they are charging so much, it’s expected that such an issue would be addressed but it is not. Unfortunate and hence the 2 stars. I’d have given 1 star if the sound quality was not upto the mark\\n', '\\n  I\\'m someone who uses earphones with utmost care (I have a storage pouch for it, my previous earphones have lasted for years together, etc)Even for me, the material wasn\\'t durable. The junction point between the audio jack and the wire started breaking in less than 6 months. In the next 2-3 months I could see the metal wires though it..and in less than 1 hour one of the earpieces stopped functioning, soon followed by the second. And since the \"damage was physical first and later technical\", it wasn\\'t covered under warranty.It\\'s really embarrassing for a huge company like JBL. I pay 800 bucks for nothing.\\n', \"\\n  I have used JBL products before and this is the first time I am disappointed. The earphones don't have an issue with sound quality but are very uncomfortable to wear beyond 30 minutes. I even tried changing the earphone buds (different sizes provided), but got no relief from the change. The Samsung earphones, though much cheaper, were more comfortable to use for longer duration.\\n\", \"\\n  I bought these earphones because I bought them previously and loved them. They did everything they are supposed to do. Alas, I myself broke them so I ordered a new set. They came quickly enough but alas, the sound quality is terrible, scratchy and my own voice is unrecognisable. Possibly a defective product? Possibly previously 'used' as the plastic bag that covered the box was clearly torn & previously opened. Hopefully not a duplicate model. Product LOOKS & FEELS great, which is why I gave it 3 stars overall rating. I am now having them replaced with a new set. If the new set works properly, I'll update this review. They are supposed to arrive in a couple of days, so stand by.Just received the free replacement, and the new ones are working normally, STILL not as good as my last pair, which were comparable to Apple EarPods, but serviceable. HOWEVER, the packaging is suspect: while Amazon's delivery pouch was fine, the manufacturer's packaging looked AGAIN as if it had been tampered with: the clear plastic  cover was again torn and looked like it had been opened and re-closed; the box itself looked the same, and one end was already opened. Either the manufacturer is at fault or the dealer is selling knock-offs. But Amazon should kindly look into this.I shall make a further addition to this review after I've used the headphones for a month.\\n\", \"\\n  After reading a lot of positive reviews and watching unboxing videos online I purchased these earphones and to be honest I found the quality of sound lacking. May be I was expecting too much. The bass is good but that's it. Listened a couple of my fav songs on spotify didn't really enjoyed them much. I dont know much about technical aspects of earphones but i do know how it feels when u r really enjoying the music. Will try other options and update my review.\\n\", '\\n  I have been using the C100 model since last 2 years and it is value-for-money. It lasts for 1 whole year, with daily use of 3 to 4 hours. After an year, the wires start breaking from the wear and tear, but at 700 to 900 Rs, this is a good buy at that price, if your budget is less than 1000 Rs like me. I have bought 3 of this model till now and very happy with its performance (for listening to music or Whatsapp videos).It is good for hearing music and taking phone calls. The mic does pickup surrounding noise, if you need to take calls from a noisy place (like an open office), then this is NOT the right model.JBL has higher models like C200 also - at a higher price. I intend to try that next time.\\n', \"\\n  I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT. THANKS TO JBL FOR MAKING SUCH A NICE PRODUCT IN THIS PRICE . AND THE VOICE QUALITY IS SUPERB AND NOISE CANCELLATION IS OP . FIRSTLY I WANT TO TELL A STORY THAT TODAY IN MORNING I WENT FOR BATH AND THE EARPHONES WERE IN MY PANT'S POCKET AMD I WASHED IT WITH DITERGENT AND THEN WHEN IT WAS TWISTING IT FOR DRYING I REALISED THAT THE EARPHONES ARE IN MY POCKET AND I JUST PANICKED AND IMMEDIATELY CHECKED ITS VOICE AND EVERYTHING AND IT WAS OK . I JUST SUGGEST YOU TO BUY THIS ITEM ITS REALLY GOOD !! SUPERB PRODUCT FROM JBLAND THANKS TO AMAZON FOR FAST AND SAFE DELIVERY IN THIS LOCKDOWN.\\n\", \"\\n  Audiophile's stay away!! Its an average earphones with good build quality but volume levels are not very high so also is the bass. The bass is not ear shattering one but comfortable, you can use with full volume but will be left wanting for more volume and bass. Treble is high,mids are below avg and bass is just avg/flat. Sound clarity is also average,some mid's are just left out and not audible enough. Noise cancellation is fair enough. Fit is good and comfortable. Earlier used skullcandy earphones(1st was basic 2nd was a mid range) and these earphones from Jbl are not even close to skullcandy's.\\n\", \"\\n  I must say that in INR.650/- I found the best deals on earphones as this earphones from JBL are really good & the sound quality is just awesome. I refer this product to one of my friend & after listening songs from my JBL earphones he immediately ordered it for him. The product is really amazing but giving one star less because it has no L shaped connector which may result into easy breaking of wire at connector side as well as the wire may experience 'Wear & Tear' soon if not used properly. Noise cancellation is also really brilliant but it could be better. The earbuds are slippery sometimes & wire looks pretty delicate so you should use it with care. Not recommended to be used while travelling in a public transport. But considering the price tag I can suggest this product to everyone.\\n\", '\\n  Using it for an hour during my commute every day.....Pros1. Fit in ear is good...does not come off2. The 3.5 mm jack too is a tight fit with the phone....implication is that both ends stay put even when navigating a crowd3. Audio quality is good... though the bass can be better4. Good value for moneyConsBuild quality is flimsy... will update review if there is an issue with the earphone\\n', \"\\n  Just the perfect set of earplugs you will need for yourself.. be it youtube videos or spotify music.. the sound is just perfect... Awesome balance between bass and treble. Noise cancellation feature is pretty good.. also I think I'm pretty addicted to JBL earplugs... The last one that I bought in 2016 is still working ... Usually earplugs tend to lose sound from one side after 6months.. only exception that I saw is with the JBL ones...\\n\", \"\\n  The sound quality is good but the wire used in the headphone is of worst quality.The wire is cut from so many places and I put tape to cover the cuts.But now its damaged too much within a time of 1.5 years that I can't use it anymore.I am using Apple earpods and few other headphones since 6-7 years and they are intact with their performance (for both sound and wiring).But this headphone is getting worse and worse day by day.See the image for a better look.So I suggest, don't go for big name always.\\n\", \"\\n  when i checked with the small size earbud it sound very silly but when i changed the earbud that fits tight for me the sound output was superior. Not as loud as my boat 180. but bass is really good. the boat 180 have superb base and superb treble so i'm able to hear a crystal clear vocals. if you are a bass lover then you can go for it.my score :bass : 8/10treble : 5/10quality of earphone : 5/10quality of cable : 5/10comfort : 7/10\\n\", \"\\n  I've purchased 2 of these headphones. Sound quality is good, but the lifespan is horrible!The first one was ordered on 23rd April 2017, and that stopped working around October 2018. Lasted a total of 1 year 6 months before it completely died, which wasn't great.Sound quality for the price was decent, so I ordered another on 12th October  2018. I am writing this review as on 30th July 2020, which is 1 year 9 months from the date of purchase and the second pair of headphones have stopped working as well.No complaints about sound quality, but if you are purchasing this product, you should know that it will stop working in under 2 years.\\n\", \"\\n  I don't understand what the hype is. The color is brilliant. Besides that its only downsides for me. The plastic feels cheap and their one button feature is the worst. That damn thing can only pause songs. And the damn thing lets everyone know what crap you are listening to 😡My better half is a big fan despite all these things. So here you go. Its confirmed. Boys will be boys..Go by visuals even though there were dozens of better brands on Amazon itself 🙄\\n\", '\\n  Sound is like 100% upto the beat and very clear, bass is balanced very nice in this price range. I ordered it before and one and half year ago and till now those are working like unbeatable but wire has been cut so I was try to find something better but after searching so many earphones i came to this coz this is top in this category fully satisfied.\\n', \"\\n  Although I'm using this earphones  for last 9 months and surprisingly there is no any issues with this earphones . I have used many earphones of Boat, mi basics, skullcandy, JBl and among all of them I found this earphones worth for money.Very good noise cancellationThe sound quality is really good as mids and vocals are greatThe bass output is not overpowered but it's decent enough and does thump where it neededPop and trouble are also really good.Also these earphones are highly comfortable.There is only one issue that the built quality of cable is not that good quality but it can survive with 6 to 7 months. It'll be available for only ₹550 on offer days.So compared to other earphones at this price range I'm definitely suggesting this earphones.\\n\", \"\\n  Tested this pair of earphones with 3 laptops (Dell, HP, Macbook), 3 phones (Redmi, Samsung, Motorola) and iPad. Even though sound quality is quite decent with unbeatable noise cancellation (I don't recommend plugging it in tight while in traffic :P), I have consistently observed that treble is slightly higher than the bass (except in my Dell laptop). If it bothers you, you can always adjust in your device's equaliser.Overall, decent buy. Build quality is okay. Tends to get a bit dirty as it is rubberised, wipe it regularly with some household cleaning liquid.Does not get entangled if you roll it up neatly and keep it in a small pouch.\\n\", '\\n  JBL known for its speaker system somehow got into earphone sector seemed a good idea.Earphones were stunning and the sound performance upto the markIt’s a budget earphone wouldn’t expect more high end standard performanceWorth the money.\\n', \"\\n  It worked like charm for a year but as soon as I completed 1 year, right side speaker stopped working. I guess, wire got damaged internally near the jack. Now I can not claim for replacement, since it has crossed the warranty period of 1 year, 5 days back.Overall I was satisfied but I would say it's not durable.\\n\", \"\\n  I read such rave reviews about this that i was compelled to follow suit and buy it. However, there are some noteworthy points to keep in mind while buying this product:1) Noise Cancellation isn't a lot but the volume range is pretty good2) there's also noise in output of the earphones, its not absolutely clear, but of course that is also because, for the price it's decent3) MI earphones (same price range) that i had before these were better, so i don't know maybe this model is not as good as those4) Overall, perhaps you can find better options at this range but this one will definitely do if you need a cheaper replacement to a set of expensive ones lost in commute or lost in wear and tear\\n\", '\\n  I bought this earphones for daily use. After few months, one ear piece stopped working. I had a rough use. Sound is great! Bass is too high to blow up your ears if you are looking for it. I have used Shure models earlier so not here to brag about IEMs to this. To make it simple, for this price this earphone is simple and good sound quality. You will like this.\\n', \"\\n  Best earphones under 800 rupees .Wrote review After using these earphones for 6 months. I have to say it's best earphone for its sound quality.Noise cancellation is too good in it.About its bass quality would say decent and build quality is nice with tangle free wire.I would say it is worth for pricing and best among range 500 to 1000 rupees earphones.Highly recommend.\\n\", '\\n  2nd time purchasing the sony mdr 155 ap and 3rd time to purchasing jbl c100si....I just love both earphone.....Both earphone are great qaulity sound.....Mdr 155ap is greater than c100si....

Got these JBL earphones in June 2020 (great sound by the way when it was working and good mic), and now here we are, in the first week of October 2020 with the right earphone producing almost no sound.I understand that earphones are prone to faults regardless of who produces it, but you know what? I have used Sennheisser CX 180 for years (kept buying it every couple of years and wore them out or misplaced them) and they have never really developed any faults within such a short span of time after purchase. So quite disappointed, and now trying to contact JBL customer service to get these replaced. Will update this review if I ever get this sorted.\\n', \"\\n  Bass is good, tried the base test videos on YouTube. However, two things that irritates me are1. Sound from the earphones can be heard outside, even from around 7-8 feet in a closed room condition2. Markings for left and right ear piece is not clearly visible and hence I'll be niw forced to mark it with a cokiur marker  possiblyOtherwise, the sound quality is good. Tested phone call and the sound was clear at both the caller and the receiver end.\\n\", '\\n  Loved it the first time I got it. Worked fine for almost two years. Then, the left side stopped working. After a few days, the right side gave in. Since, it was comfortable even when used for extended periods of time and I liked the sound quality, I went ahead and ordered another one. As luck would have it, this time it worked for three months. Now, only one side is working for the last few days.\\n', '\\n  THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME. FITS PERFECTLY. NOISE CANCELLATION GOOD.CONS: THE RIGHT SIDE IS NOW DAMAGED WITHIN TWO MONTHS FROM THE DAY OF PURCHASE. AUDIO ON TH RIGHT SIDE IS VERY VERY LOW.Claiming warranty from JBL is a pain...Sent the product for servicing/warranty claim by fulfilling all the requirements.Not a single update been received from the service centre end.Customerr support will only console you by saying that they are looking into it,  but in vain.It would be better to buy a new pair of any otherbrand othet than jbl that provides promising support.\\n', '\\n  JBL makes good high end products, and this attempt of making an budget earphones was not properly executed by JBL.Dont buy this product.JBL has done some clear cost cutting on the product and one can make out from the physical quality of it. The wires are really thin, they will not be able to take the abuse of daily use.Audio quality is good, but not worth paying 700 for.There are other alternatives you must consider.Mi earphonesSheniserBoatall have good audio quality.\\n', '\\n  NOT a \" SONY \" XB , don\\'t expect it to be.Value for money , good sounding buds at this price point.Not as bassy as Sony XB seriesSony XB is better in terms of build quality and sound and it will cost you about double.Sweet highsMids are okayishLows ar okayishIt tries to maintain the consumer grade smile EQ curve ,Silicone plugs are not good , could have been far better at this price range , i have seen better ones at lower price. I am using it with a good pair of after market Sony Plugs.If you are not spending more than 1k , go for it.\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality is excellentBass is goodVocals are very clear, you can hear small instrument soundsMic quality is goodNoise cancellation is good it can't eliminate all the surrounding noise but other parties won't complaint about any disturbance or something.Overall jbl has done excellent job and I started to like this very muchpreviously I used sennheiser 180 and I liked it but the wire quality is not great when compared to jbl 100Neck to neck competition in sound qualityAnd in sennheiser 180 you don't have mic and this one have\\n\", '\\n  I am writing this review after 2 years, 7 months of using it. One earpiece just stopped working. But for 700, 2 and half year of great sound for me was totally worth it.Color: Although I highly recommend not buying the color white. As it gets really dirty real soon and is visible . I would recommend any other color.Comfort: The in ear buds were really comfortable, the fit was good and I had faced no pain or uneasiness during long usage.Mic: I have used it for calls and meeting on my laptop. Great! No complaints from the receiving end about any voice problems.Sound: I have used Sennheiser CX 180 Street II In-Ear Headphone (Black) prior to this. And honestly in normal use you don\\'t feel that much of a difference unless you are a real music freak. But I slightly felt the sennheiser is better in the sound category as many of my friends also tested it and found jbl lacking in this department.But overall, a complete \"paisa vasool\" for me. Although with sennheiser having warranty as an advantage plus sound is better on that one. I would prefer sennheiser over this.\\n', '\\n  \"\"\"Good Sound Quality\"\"\"Pros:1. Sound quality is so good in this headphone.2. Design also so good.3. Bass is amazing in this headphone.4. It will not give you any pain in your ears.5. If have mic so you can do voice calls.6. You can adjust your wire size where two wires join.7. You will get extra rubber with the headphone.Cons:1. Not so louder but loud as we need.Overall it is soo good in this price so that I choose this brand.Thank You Guys.\\n', '\\n  Do buy this amazing product by Jbl. Been using it for more than 6 months now, it is one of the best product at this range from a renounced brand.I have selected the red colour, found it quite attractive.The sound quality is good, it doesnt let outside noise to come in , i suggest reduce the sound speed while walking on busy roads.\\n', '\\n  FOr this price, its a good product. Noise cancellation is not that great but sound outpout is fairly good. I have a old Mi phone which itself does not have a great sound output, but this works fine with it.. If its raining outside for example, the sound is not audible even with high volume. Fits well, looks good. Sufficient length of the cable. I use it running on the treadmill. Works great. Recommended for limited budget and low expectations for sound\\n', \"\\n  I am writing this review after using it for more than a year. Frankly, it's not very durable earphone especially from the button side. The wire just start splitting from this places. After a year one side of headphone sounds less than other.Overall if your priority is high bass this isn't for you.But if you like balanced sound it's good.Its give you good bass where it is meant to be in music.\\n\", '\\n  I bought this earphones in October after three month im going to give a review . These earphones are awesome highs mids and lows are well balanced and gives clear audio clarity. Those who want quality sound of three different types of  sounds like snare ,bass and treble this is the correct one to have the quality of music . I compared with skull candy riff and boat and sony .in skull candy treble and snare sounds are compressed but in the jbl you can get every bit of snares  sound quality highs, mids ,lows, are well balanced Jbl is awesome . I love this earphones .product . Overall the product is good no problems with this . Finally i give advice to people . Those who have to buy a earphones in budget these earphones is the best choice .\\n', \"\\n  Microphone dead within two months.More importantly you will not find any service centre specially in Kolkata.They provide the warranty for a year which is completely fake as they don't pick up the phone while calling their number.I have wasted my money completely buying this headphone.\\n\", \"\\n  Instrumental sounds are very very clear .......High-Mid tones are so clear though you will get a comfortable highIn terms of low(Bass) yes bass is there but not like Boat-Realme like they add just extra boosted bass but this JBL C100SI produce perfect amount of bass where it requires the bass . Personally I'ma bass lover guy , I just loved it though.lastly the build quality is average not feels like premium fitting is very good but i don't think this will last more than 6 months though it has 12months warranty- JBL &Harman has best after sale service they will replace the product and send it to your home.If build quality is your 1st priority the go for Realme Buds2 otherwise this is the best product for 600/-ThankYou for reading this.\\n\", \"\\n  Have been using it since 1.6 yrs and is still going good. The best earphone out there in this range.The bass, the treble all sounds perfect unlike other earphones which suppress either bass or treble a bit.I did face some issue in its mic for some days after 6 months of using it, but then it worked ok on its own.Go for this. You won't regret.1.6 yrs is a long time, lets see how long more will it work!! Will keep you posted!Edit: Unfortunately the right side has stopped work and the mic too. But im glad it worked for 18 months.\\n\", '\\n  Noise cancelling not working. Other party can clearly hear my tv sound, my kid shouting.while on call...jbl just making people fool by saying active noise cancelling technology but what is this_ other party can clearly hear all nearby sound along with my voice. Planning to file a legal case against this since they are duping, defrauding customers.\\n', '\\n  I didn\\'t like the earphone at all... Sound quality is not good .. i was using boat 225 bass earphone which is far far better then this...where the price is lesser then JBL earphone... Don\\'t buy it...  They will not take it back.. only they will replace it... \"Bachke rehna\"\\n', '\\n  So this is the review after using these JBL earphones for about 3 weeks.First of all thnx to amazon for always timely delivery.Moving towards the product - a simple, brief and clear review :JBL - a brand name when it comes to music lovers. A brand where competetion meets its arrogance. JBL C100SI earphones comes here when its comes for the amazing crystal breaking clear sound like each crack can be  purely experienced. A decent priced earphone but dont knw why JBL didnt implement the bass experience in it.Sound as discussed it really very amazing, pure, stereo dimensions can purely be experienced on connecting to a 3D source.What i dont like in it is THE VERY HIGH TREBLE AND VERY LOW BASS. THE MAX VOLUME IS JUST AVERAGE, AMD MINIMUM IS TOO TOO TOO MUCH LOW TO BE HEARD. You need to connect to a third equilizer source for enhancing bass.Design is pretty much decent but not so classy as compared to its price range. Again JBL does its best in engravimg its brand name in every part of the earphones.The bend type eardrums should be slightly more bended in order to be perfectly supportive to the cheeks and the ear area.Dont knw why none of here in these reviews hav mentioned its recording quality. Guys this is the segment where JBL C100SI meets the target. I keep recording songs with karaoke and really thumbs up to JBL for its mic. The stereo recording quality is really very much impressive. I am a fond of singing and spend most times in starmaker app. These earphone really gives an amazing record over other earphones. I have tried MDR series, skullcandy, Boat but mic quality was not decent upto their price segment..Overall rating : 8/10Overall the earphone is good for music lovers who love slow songs where bass is not a matter.. But in this price segment its good..\\n', \"\\n  This is such a terrible ear piece - absolutely no bass - didn't expect this from JBL - figuring out how to get this replaced. The MI earphones sound so much better. Never again JBL. Same thing happened with my Sony earphones - seems like cheaper versions of the big brands have low quality bass (actually this one totally removes all the bass).\\n\", \"\\n  I bought this product expecting it to work and enjoy the music. But one of the ear is not working. It's been only some 20 days and it is not working properly. When I first used it self i found this problem. So I checked with other phones and this problem is there with the earphones.\\n\", \"\\n  The first product which got delivered had an issue with the right ear piece. There was a buzzing sound in the right ear piece. I returned it and got another new product.Surprisingly, this new product has a issue with the mic and the button. While watching any video on my phone with this earphone plugged in, google assistant starts and my volume goes down.This is happening on a regular basis since the time I received the product.I am very unhappy with this product.Now i have to visit the service center for warranty claim. Unnecessary wastage of time and money.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT ONLINE.\\n\", \"\\n  Since I'm using the boat bassheads 220 wired headset, I can't compare it with this JBL C100 headset. Yet I expected a good bass effect or noise cancellation. However I find this headset very useful for calling and voice conversations clear and crisp.Final judgement: For crazy music lovers who want to feel the effects of bass and treble, try boat headsets and other ones. If you are using JBL C100 for normal music and calling features, blindly go for it. You will never be disappointed!!Add on: This does not fall off from your ears while jogging or cycling.\\n\", '\\n  Used this product for 7-8 months and it suddenly stopped working. The build quality was amazing but the sound was average. The bass quality is okayish compared to sennheiser but the bass can be tweaked using applications. I ordered this earphones considering the brand recognition of JBL but was hugely disappointed. If you are looking for something for overall good music experience you can give this a try but I feel the price is a bit High considering its durability.\\n', \"\\n  My headset stopped working, and are under warranty, still not able to replace it, as brand is asking me to send it to their service center by courier... Ideally they should have pick up ans drop in case they don't have service center in city.I also sent them courier with invoice and headset inside the box, still they rejected it saying invoice should be attached outside the box. Very bad service\\n\", '\\n  Previously I owned phillips headset.. Those where good. The sound clarity & fit is similar with jbl set as well. The one big factor that irritates me is the scratchy noise I feel in my ears when using this product when the wires get in contact with anything including my clothes or body or anything it touches while plugged in ear. It is probably due to mat finish wire rather than smooth wires. Apart from that good.\\n', \"\\n  First of all get wary of its printed demand ' rich bass' which is not at all present. If you are not a boom boom kinda person go for it for its crisp and clear sound. Leaving bass everything is well balanced. Mic is also very good with good amount of noise cancellation. The wire gets tangled, but that will not be an issue as you can jolly well enjoy music without ear ache or heating of ear. So, bass lovers go for boat and for others it is yours. To be honest fair pricing should have been hundred bucks less.\\n\", \"\\n  I am really disappointed with this one. The earphone stopped working completely in 5 months. Initially too I faced issues with low mic sensitivity when on calls. The other person couldn't hear a thing until I eat the mic. I complained about that as well to the customer care, but there were of no help. Then last week the right earphone, where the mic is, stopped working. I am not buying earphones from JBL again.\\n\", \"\\n  I have brought this headphone on 5th march and it's left side ear bud stops working in october.As it wa in warnatty but JBl service centers are limited and customercare telling a long process to replace it\\n\", \"\\n  Edit: Changing review after checking that they show manufacturing in USA in product details, which is a lie, as there is a clearl made in china tag on the earphone.Good sound at this price range, but not that great to say that built quality is compromised for cost cutting. I mean, unlIke the sennheiser sound quality (I was using an old model), sound quality isn't that great. Again, good at this price point, but built is bad. Wires are week and they do tangle a lot. Comes with three sizes of buds as useul.\\n\", '\\n  Comfortable and lightweight earphones with well balanced sound. Build quality is okay.JBL should offer a tangle free or braided cable, even cheaper earphones have braided or tangle free cables.Deducted 1 star for regular cable and damaged \"Ear Tips\" ( got a pair of good quality ear tips from a small local shop ).I would still recommend it ( if your budget is under 700 rs ), the sound quality is better than the competition.Reviewing after using for about a year, still working as expected. Build quality is good, if you can overlook the outdated wire 🙂\\n', '\\n  I have bought these earphones several times...these are not  among the best ones...neither are they as bad..but since I was getting it this time at a fair price for 550/- I bought it in sale..It has guarantee of one year this is the plus point...as I have claimed new pair if it goes off before one year...normally these will work fine for about 9-10 months on average as I have experienced many times then you need to buy new ones...\\n', \"\\n  Today I would like to compare it with Realme Bud 2.In terms of build quality Realme slightly better. Realme is 1inch longer than JBL c100si. But Realme gives 6 months warranty and JBL gives 1 year warranty. Both has mic. But JBL has one control button and Realme has three buttons, one control button and other two to increase or decrease volume. JBL hasn't any rubber band/strap to organise it's cable. Realme cable are braided nylon cord whereas JBL use normal rubber material cable. Though both are tangle free, but Realme is better in terms of cable quality and to manage it's cable than JBL.Now comparing sound quality, I found JBL far better than Realme. Many YouTube blogger said that Realme sound is best in ₹600 -700 price range earphone segment because of it's 11mm driver. They gave better position to Realme than JBL. Though Realme has 11mm driver, but it's sound is noisy. JBL sound quality is smoother than Realme. Bass and treble everything is clear and the sound doesn't disturb your ear. I can say it sounds like Sony music system. You will surely love to listen music with JBL c100si earphone.In terms of fitting, both are good. But JBL has little bit edge over Realme because of it's shape. And Realme is slightly heavier than JBL.Regarding call quality, I didn't find any difference in call quality in either of these earphones. The sound is clear in both ends.Hope this review will give you a clear idea to choose the right one...👍\\n\", \"\\n  This earphone is very best in this price segment because of sound quality and mic.Another headphones is available but price is little bit expensive sennheiser. But cx180 don't have mic.Otherwise that one is also best\\n\", '\\n  Got it in Rs 599 with bank discount. And truely speaking the sound quality is worth every penny. Mid & low tones are very clear like premium headphones. Build quality is little bit poor due to low cable quality. But the music is tuned so perfectly that you do not have to worry about settings. It clearly beats Mi in ear headphones with 699 price tag bcoz the mid tones & treble are way better than Mi in this JBL. Choose it over Mi with close eyes.\\n', '\\n  I ordered JBL C100SI and Realme buds 2JBL C100SI : Bass is not as expected, build quality looking link road side low quality meterial. 3.5 RatingRealme Buds 2 : Good build quality and bass is extradionary, I like breaded cable with built-in magnet speakers. And volume adjustment buttons, cable organizer band is good option. 4.5 Rating\\n', '\\n  JBL C100SI is completely fantastic!JBL is always on my top list when it comes to music.Lets talk about the product.1. The packaging of the product will stop you from opening the product in first go as its so attractive. The earphone is so nicely and accurately packed that it cannot be damaged from anywhere when inside the box.2. After you open the packaging, you will feel the softness of the earbuds so good that you cant stop yourself from plugging it to your phone.3. JBL earphones comes up with 2 additional earbuds which you can use accordingly as per your comfort zone.4. JBL is unbeatable when it comes to sound quality and bass quality. The sound is so perfect with 0 disturbance and gives you a feeling that you are listening to music into a night club.5. It gives no pain to your ears when used for hours.6. The material used in the earphone is high quality and this JBL earphone is totally worth the price and you cant skip buying.So what are you waiting for?Grab yours now!Thanks JBL for this amazing product!\\n', '\\n  Please DON’T buy this product. I don’t have any issue in this product but these earphones are not up to the mark in quality and they are not value for money. Bass is just minimal, sound is very loud and very cracky which penetrating into the ears and it is very uneasy and unpleasant to listen. Rather you buy boAt bass heads 100 earphones priced around 370-400 with that Opera House shape. Don’t buy bass heads 500 also, they also tend to fall out from ears.\\n', '\\n  I purchased this one year ago and I dont use them roughly,(I have a box for them). Within 6-7 months the left earbud was not working and then after some months the jack wire was worn out. I had to put black tape. Then again the right side was also not working. End of duration after one year. The cheap headphones from motorala,samsung are working from 3-4 years but sadly the materials are substandard and not durable.\\n', '\\n  Overall sound quality and Bass is even good compared with there high price range and it is distortion free. It works well with Google assistant. I mostly use while I am riding bike and Google assistant follows my commands like call a friend, open music app and play music, pause, previous or next song, volume control and much more. I am enjoying it.\\n', \"\\n  JBL, as per goodwill this particular product is not up to mark. Wires are too thin and automatically it gets cut at different different points. Only Sound is ok but product doesn't have durability. JBL should provide products as per their credibility, not degrades their standard.\\n\", \"\\n  Had already these in white colour and now ordered again because old ones got broken after 2 years of time.I must tell you , these earphones are the beast in such a low price. I got it on 4th December, 2019 for just @600 INR.it has ample of bass and good Balance of treble and mids, looks cool and has light weight.Doesn't fall of ears at all. I bought black one because white one gets dirty easily.I have chosen it compared to Sennheiser cx 180 for 2 reasons:1. It has a decent mic with buttons2. It has good bass compared to cx180, just 19-21 difference in bass.I am sure you would love it at this price and be happy for at least 1 year with its warranty period 🙂🍻🍻\\n\", \"\\n  ⭐The JBL CS 100 is the only best In-Ear headphones which is very minimal and ergonomical⭐This thing is light weight and has a better fit in you ear, Hence the earphones wont fall away,⭐ Coming to the durability, the cables are made of best material which will last for atleast one year with normal usage.*If ur a heavy user who uses the earphones all the time like in the bed, in the bike, it'll last for six-eight months.⭐The sound quality here feel pretty premium, No music feels like ur sitting inside an empty water drum, This thing got a wonderful driver which provides extraordinary bass.Finally❤️ I've been using the Jbl C100 SI for around 4 yrs and ive changed 3 pairs, still i love this Earphones, It's the best bang for the buck, I will heartly recommend my friend!\\n\", \"\\n  This is my second time buying the same product. I bought it for my family and they love using it. It absolutely does the job and is great even if you want to use it as your primary mic while on phone calls.The audio quality is great and is good to watch movies and videos. The build quality feels much better than other brands of about the same price. I've bought many earphones so far and these are the ones that have lasted the most.I'd definitely recommend this, especially if you get it during a sale.\\n\", '\\n  Searching for all rounder earphone at a reasonable price, then this is it.1 year warrantyCan download the invoice from amazon n claim for a replacement from ur nearest jbl service center against manufacturing defects within warranty periods.M using it for 5 days now.Will keep this review updated with days of usage.\\n', \"\\n  I received my earphone 2 days ago. I have played almost 100 of songs to check the output quality.  To my surprise, the earphone gives me a clear audio and not biased towards bass tone. Here are my ratings:Sound Quality: 4/5. It gives me a sound quality equivalent to Senheiser CX 275, but in comparison with the price, I would appreciate JBL for bringing this quality on a low priced earphone.Material Quality: 3/5The cables do not look like it is going to last longer unless you use it with much care. It properly fits into my ear and it is very lightweight like there is nothing attached to my ear.Packaging: 5/5I can't complain about the way the item was packed.Shipment and Delivery: 1/5It took almost 10 days to receive the item and thus far this is the longest time period I had to  wait to receive any product from Amazon and I hate the way this was dealt by the courier.Overall: If you are a music lover who wants to enjoy the music as it is, then this product worth the money you spend. It does not add Bass or Treble or any other kind of boost to the Music output. I like to listen to classical music and this product is fine for my music taste.\\n\", \"\\n  They're not bad. Have a LOT of bass and like most cheap earphones, emphasize alot on the mids and highs. They are clear, but just like all cheap earphones, they sound muddier as time goes. Be careful though! They can be easily destroyed by water or sweat.\\n\", \"\\n  It's good in this price value of 6-700. Got it in sale for 600. Sound is decent, bass is ok, I have used previously CX180 without mic that was too good if u don't need mic like in colleges. Now I know the value of mic. Mic & wire is pretty small with premium look in JBL print over earpiece. Soound is clear with bit high pitch. 1 bass level down in compare to Senhiser. Note Senhizer outclass many expensive earphones so this JBL is also very good in compare to others in market.\\n\", \"\\n  The overall performance of the earphones is awesome. The Bass and noise cancellation work quite well.I feel it's a common problem with all the wired earphones, that they work well to only a certain time period.Till the time they are working okay, they sound excellent. The one I have received is moody. All of a sudden one of the earpiece will stop working. It continues for a few days and then starts working well of its own as if there was no problem at all. Just imagine, it has never ever been into the hands of a toddler and I have been handling it very carefully, then too, this type of problem happens. Now I'm used to this.To make the long story short, the earphones are of good quality.Eventually, all wired earphones start giving trouble after a point of time.\\n\", '\\n  Mic stopped working within a month of purchase hardly a week of actual usage. JBL used to be good but lost its value now as they started to make cheap products.I am not an audio savvy- bass/ treble doesn\\'t matter to me, if it has some decent clear sound and serves its purpose, am more than okay with it, saying that i also don\\'t compromise on quality/endurance so always choose good brands.I had bought the the same model 2years back and it is still working fine except for regular wear and tear.As my old JBL earphone was having cable issues (after 2years), I happen to buy the same model - Amazon buy again :P(do not want to experiment with other brands)  , \"with expectations on JBL\", but the mic gave up just within a month of purchase hardly a week of actual usage; that too while i was on a call and the person at the other end gradually lost my voice through the call : it was embarrassing :(The earphone\\'s build looked cheap and sound output was also not that good, when compared to the same model bought 2 years back.If you are planning to buy from JBL kindly think twice as the brand quality is no more, it has become like unreliable Chinese product; instead you could spend on other medium / low end earphones and save your money for the same quality\\n', \"\\n  Headphones are nice especially high notes are awesome but durablity is a big worry here...Cables are not upto the mark it's not tangle free so you will end up wasting time in using it after you pull out from packet or bag... This is practical scenario here...You will get extra ear buds and that's it.. no carrying case.. at this price point ANT doble w2 provides headphones with carrying case with better cable quality and sounds awesome....  So choose wisely according to your needs.\\n\", \"\\n  I am writing a simple review to give am idea of the product.1} SOUND: Minds,lows and highs are totally balance. Output is very good. Vocals are very Clear. Tribles are also excellent. The overall sound quality is excellent.Sound quality is better than Mi Basic,Boat bassheads 225.2} BUILD: Build is average. You have to handle it little bit carefully. Not for the extreme rough users. Mi basic and boat bassheads 225 has better build quality.3} COMFORT: No words to say. It is one of the most comfortable earphone. It is more comfortable than mi basic and boat bassheads 225. If you need Comfort the don't go with Boat.4} Mic: Sound produced through mic is clear. The button is also having a feature to play previous track.5} Instruments separation: It has good Instruments separation. Good for pubg players.6} Bass: It produces good bass.I got it for ₹549 and it really worth it!\\n\", \"\\n  I bought this headphone in June 29th 2020 and it has stopped working on 20 th September. I contacted for the warranty claim but I stricted me to go to service which will cost more than the product valu. I decided not to claimed warranty and dispose off the product. This is the second times I bought the same from jbl but it didn't last even two months for both. It is worst experience from jbl.\\n\", \"\\n  The new JBL C100SI is a dynamic, ultra-lightweight in-ear headphone. Its has powerful bass response and legendary sound quality you expect from JBL.The noise cancellation could have been better but still the product is really good.I have been using this product almost for 4months now and even being used roughly it is so durable that the wire covering won't cut open like other headphones.The best part about it is that on being compared Skullcandy S2DUDZ-058 Jib Earphone (Rasta)Which comes in approximately the same price range this product highly dominates over this.It is a headphone which I would recommend others to buy as it is a headphone which according to me would last for a long time even after rough usage.Overall a must buy product\\n\", \"\\n  I bought this because my old earphone got damaged, it was the same model which i bought 3 years back!!. I am a rough user, i used it while at the gym, took it along for all my journies, slept using it still it had no issues, last week my kitchen fire accidentally damaged the item.Coming to the product, sound quality is awesome for this price range, good in ear fit. You get 3 additional sizes of ear plugs with the package.The bass is reasonable, well it's not the best out there, but good for long listening time.Noice cancellation is good(not the best out there ), since it is a secure fit inside your ear, even then u can be aware of your surroundings.The length of the chord is perfect.There is a mic, which is loud and clear while phone call sessions.There is a switch right next to the mic, which trigger 'attend call' when the phone rings, 'end call' to finish the call. Pressing and holding will trigger google assistant. While listening music, one press-play/pause, double press for next song, triple press for previous song.Like i previously mentioned this thing is beast when it comes to durability.The box comes with a one year warranty also(you have to register your product manually on their website after receiving the product)As a 3 year user of this product the only minus points i have to say is, it does not have volume control switch.All over very impressive product. If you are planning to buy a wired earphone in this price range, this is the one for you.\\n\", '\\n  Very much disappointed with this.1-Quality of wire used is not good.2-Sound is similar to any Chinese made earphone which is available for 50 Rs in the market.3-Your ears will pain after long usage as not designed properly.\\n', \"\\n  BUILD QUALITYStarting with the build quality this is having just ok kind of build quality. Wire quality after the split is so much cheap and thinSOUND QUALITYWhen it comes to sound I would divide this review into three parts1. LOWER FREQUENCIES  lower sounds or bass is not highly emphasized when the bass is required it just comes and it goes. These are not recommended for heavy bass heads2.MID TONES  when it comes to mid-tones they are produced very well on this one especially vocals are emphasized singers voice is pretty good on this one3.HIGH TONES  when it comes to high tones I would say JBL did a miracle here you would definitely hear a lot about tunes from guitar, violin and other instruments. The sound stage is also excellentVERDICTcoming to verdict I would say these sound incredible for what you are paying. These JBL c100si impressed me a lot in terms of sound quality. I would suggest not to buy the JBL c200 si because they are just rebranded version of these at a higher price. If you want a pair of earphones especially for bass go with real me buds 2 or Sennheiser cx180 street 2. If you want to listen pure melodious kind of music trust me these are the best you can get .. you could even use an equalizer by chance if you want to increase the bass. I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase\\n\", \"\\n  I bought two of these one for myself and one for my dad and we both love the product. It lasted for a year for my unit and my dad's unit is lasting more than a year! Speaking of the bass output which the brand claims I would say it is actually true, you do get a good amount of bass output here. overall liked the product and its worth a 4-star rating. however, 1 star is less due to lack of braided cable or flat style cable which increases the life of the earphone\\n\", \"\\n  I bought this headphones 4 month before but 5 days earlier it's right side bass is not working and had low sound from right side. I complained (on 10-10-18) for replacement and I got it after five days (Today 15-10-18). Brand New with full bass the way I want. Great product but had bad experience. If anyone had same problem or anything and if your product is within warranty then contact to Harman Customer Care Toll Free no. : 1800 102 0525 for further instructions.\\n\", '\\n  sound quality is pretty good considering its price point but that\\'s exactly what u expect from a \"jbl\"....however besides the sound quality the built quality is average...its not tangle free no use of braided cables...plus the remote/mic has only one button and no volume controls...at the same price point the realme buds 2 is a steal of a deal..sound quality is at par if not better but the material used on that is far better than the jbl ..it comes with braided cables, magnetic buds, PROPER controls like pause/play button and volume controls as well...at the end it\\'s your own personal preference if u value the \"brand name\" more or \"overall quality\"\\n', \"\\n  Been using this pair for over a year and a half and can tell you with confidence that this is awesome pair of earphones for the priceThings i like:• The sound quality it superb....the highs, lows and mids are crystal clear.... you'll enjoy it.• There's ample amount of bass ( it's not overpowering, which is good), it comes when needed.• Comfortable.• Extremely value for money.• Durable.• Has a Mic.Things i don't like:• The build quality, i know i said it's durable, because it is. It's not bad but it's not confidence inspiring either. My sony's gave up after 6 months of use...which had better quality wire but this lasted long...so i guess can't really complain.• Not for bass heads (but it is enough).• Mic quality is is straight up garbage but it's there nonetheless.\\n\", \"\\n  Noise cancellation is horrible. Bass is ok. Not atball durable worked only 6 months and one side sound is dead. Sound quality was great overall.If u are purchasing it for everyday use like listening music, watching movies then it's the best. But if u are on a call or want to use the mic , I will suggest get a better one.Gaming experience with this is horrible only because of its mic.Even the end on the cable that is to be attached to the slot is not at all comfortable, cos it's pointy.For me it gave an horrible experience.(2/5)\\n\", '\\n  It has been 1 year and 1 month since i bought this ear phone. Actually I bought two of this. One for my friend who is a regular user and the other for me. I use this very rarely especially for watching movies only.My friend replaced it once before 5 months,and even the replaced one is damaged with in this time. So he bought another ear phone 1 mnth back.I suggest, if you are a frequent user that means calling, hearing music, etc for a longer period per day, please dont go for this one.It is not fitting perfectly in my ear. But fitting was ok for my friendTrebble is more, bass is not much.Noise cancellation is not present\\n', \"\\n  Well I am a bass lover and I was confused whether what to buy sennhesier cx 180 or bass heads 225 after a week research I decided to go for JBL 100Si and 200Si is same quality as 100si so dont buy and waste money..  And to be honest I am using for almost 6 hrs non stop and bass is okay with deep bass but if you  use a equaliser  then you can get some bass over all I am happy with the product but gonna return soon and check for sennheiser cx 180.. If you want everything balanced then these earphones are for you :)This is one stop review and dont waste time for which one to choose and Bass Lovers dont go for thia please they  doesn't  satisfy our bass fever!\\n\", '\\n  This is toally fake product! It is my mistake that, I bought it from here, This is totally roadside product, which you can easily buy it within 100-200 Rs not more than that. If you really wanna buy original earphone then checkout there website and buy from there, because no one can give you JBL earphone at this much low price.\\n', '\\n  I have been using these earphones for months now..Very well builtGood noise cancellation, I had to use the smallest size caps for my earsMic works well, I use it for most of my conference callsI dont use it for Music though.Can be used to play fortnite.. I get good feedback on positioning of the opponent.\\n', '\\n  FIRST IMPRESSION: Great quality sound. Handy control on the cord. Soft earplugs fit snugly.AFTER 1 MONTH: Now the microphone introduces static noise as if due to a loose connection. Also the device volume is brought down to zero voluntarily. Something wrong with the volume control and mic fob on the wire. Now the return window is closed, so my money is wasted.\\n', \"\\n  I was stuck between cx180 and c100si. Finally I chose c100si since it has a mic (cx180 doesn't has one) and also my friend has been using it for over 3 years now. So I thought it's durable.Initially my experience was ok ok. But after using for a week, I really fell in love with these.Pros: 1. Sound stage is awesome. You can hear every instrument sound.(string sounds are awesome)2. Vocals are crystal clear.3. Light weight.4. In line mic is very handy.Cons: 1. Bass is average. (Ofcourse It has bass, but it's not thumping bass)2. I felt treble is too high.3. Here and there I feel pain in ears.I've also used cx180 which were awesome with more immersive sound.But if you need a mic and also want to listen to good music, jbl is really fine. 👍\\n\", '\\n  Checked the earphones, sound quality good, bass quality good. Do not compare it with high value earphones cause you get what you have paid for. Also picked up Electomania Round Zipper Universal Head-Mounted Portable Headset Box to store them. Now have to check how long does itre writing the review after one complete year of use. And still going strong.. not disappointed. So if you are looking for a durable set of earphones for daily use, these are the ones....\\n', '\\n  Excellent product. My husband is using it for his zoom calls while working from homr during this covid 19 situation. He is actually finding it a great product except the wire which is very thin....if you are not very messy, you will not find it difficult to use. It has very good sound and bass quality and it cancels noise around you.\\n', \"\\n  I have used other JBL earphones before and would vouch for them but this one is so below expectations. Currently I'm in need of one hence I won't be returning it but this surely won't get my good review. Either I got a fake or this model is not worth purchasing.\\n\", \"\\n  See guys  there is always a confusion while going to buy a new set of earphones ..I have used mi basic,mi,boat bassheads 225,etc .So at the price range <700 this is worth buying compared to mi basic and mi and boat ..boat can also be a good choice as it has a L shape connector ..but Jbl has some extra loudness and bass..but it is your luck upto how many days you won't get any problem in the earbuds ..as i have usually seen the main problem with budget earphones is that one of the earbuds stop working within some weeks of buying ..So mi basic is worst in this case..Go for this if you are getting confusion over mi,boat,senheiser etc..\\n\", \"\\n  I've been using this since last 4 years. A hands-free with classic build quality, really good sound quality, balancing and awesome finish. The design is very proper to fit in your ears and not giving you the pain after 2 3 hours. I use this daily for like 4 to 5 hours and it's great. If you're a rough user, go for this. Mine has been through a lot of torture and the sound is still fresh. A total worthy product!!!\\n\", '\\n  I am writing this review after using this product for one year and I must say this is hell of a product. The sound quality is  just as it was on day 1 which is just amazing. Most durable earphone with an awesome built quality. The only problem I am currently facing is about the microphone which is not working now. But as my earphones are exposed to water many times that might have damaged it (problem started almost after 10 months). At the end I must say it is best earphone out there in the market.\\n', '\\n  I have bought it before a week. I am looking for good sound producing headphone with decent bass and mic. I have searched little bit and found this one...After using for a week... The Quality of sound from this is best, decent high nots and good bass than others in this price range. Music in sound is little bit higher but you can equilize it, so in sound department its one of the best.Build quality is like average. It should lasts long if handled carefully. Single Button to play pause, change track, take and cut the calls...So overall good one compared with others in market till now... But price is little high as compared to build quality (Bought in ₹650/-)\\n', \"\\n  I decided to write a review only after a certain period of usage of the product and it's been six months now. The earphones are probably the best piece you'll get in this price range. They are very durable and sound quality is just awesome. Their hasn't been amy problem in the last six months and by my experience till now I think they'll last a year or two from now. I've also tried the JBL T110 and skullcandy one's but I find these way better than them.The only problem in these is that they don't have a tangle free flat cable but trust me that isn't a verybig issue. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because of this, otherwise they would have been the perfect piece to buy.I travel alot and the earphones are active for atleast 4 5 hours per day. So if you are an average user who just loves music just like me, you should definitely go for them.\\n\", \"\\n  I brought a Sennheiser cx180 last year. And it's a perfect competitor of jbl C100SISo I will be writing the pros and cons of both one by comparing themJBL Pros😍=======1. Treble and bass is good😊2. Mic with multi functional switch (single switch)3. Design4. Cables are good (compared with cx100)5. Even in full volume no sound fluctuations🎉🎊Cons😰====1. Not comfortable as CX1002. The connecting tip is straight (L shape is durable)3. The warranty period (comparing with cx 100)Sennheiser CX180 Pros😍===================1. Comfortable and light weight2. Warranty period3.

Cables are very thin 😦 easily breakable (one ear piece stopped working after 6 months and I repaired 🤗5. No controller button and micAnd at last i think that if u love bass and a controller and a mic than sound clarity and treble then go for jbl  NB : personal opinion\\n\", \"\\n  •The Bass quality is not as expected and doesn't sound good at high volumes.•The Build is Good as expected.•It is stylish in appearance and looks attractive .•There is a room for improvement in sound quality.\\n\", '\\n  This is my 5th or 6th JBL earphone, have been a fan ever since I bought my first one from JBL. The best thing about these earphones is the tangle free cable. You can hold it a handful and keep it in your pockets worry free. Bass is superb after you make some tweaks in your phones equalizer. Noise cancellation is excellent during voice calls, the other party can only hear my voice and no background noise.\\n', \"\\n  What should I say about this. Its totally awesome. Got this after getting suggested by blogger technical guruji on YouTube. This earphone is dope😜 it has awesome sound quality fits wel in ear. Highly recommend to all. Must buy product. I got this in only 1 day which is express delivery in ZERO shipping charges. Its bass and vocals are damn clear. I don't know why people go for boAt extra bass which is totally bakwas. I've returned that n ordered this1. However the price range is high but in sale I got this for Rs. 549 which is such a affordable rate for such an superbly amazing earphones.\\n\", \"\\n  If you are a bass lover then you can go for it. If you like soft music then it will not fulfill your needs. Overall sound quality is same as boat225. One positive thing is that it's very lightweight, you can easily enjoy your music for couple of hours.My suggestion for soft music lover is Sennheiser! It's just heart melting.\\n\", \"\\n  Earphone is good. One can buy with confidence for good sound. But do not think of any brand support in case it doesn't function as intended. It's mic got unserviceable in 6 Months. Called 18001020525 and wrote an email to support@harmanaudio.in but all in vain. So don't consider it a branded earphone for brand support but it's having good sound quality.\\n\", \"\\n  From a brand like JBL, this earphone does not fit the bill.The bass quality 'which JBL is very well known for' was not there,because of which many sounds were missing! Though, clarity is overtly enhanced. The provided earbuds can get slightly painful if you don't have BIG EARS!\\n\", \"\\n  Best voice quality.Most comfortable to the ears even after continuous use for 3-4 hours.Perfect fitting inside the ear, which gives you good noise cancellation.Satisfactory for calls also.P.S. My last earphones were also In-ear JBL earphones. (Don't remember exact model name)I had used them for 5 years, so they were time-tested & I was very much happy with its performance till its last breath.So, I had a very high expectations from this one when I ordered.And this product has proven itself with equally good sound and mic quality.I was slightly confused whether to go for C100SI or some other model like C150SI, C200SI etc.But I kept it to the basic model and that seems enough for me at present.Though it should be noted that I haven't experienced the other higher version models of JBL In-Ear Headphones.And durability of this one is yet to be tested.\\n\", \"\\n  At the given price, it's better than the other brands out there.pros:*brand label JBL*funky color options to choose from*wires do not get tangled everytime you take in/out from pocket*good bass*microphone is quite clear even in outdoors*lightweight and fits perfectly inside ears*comes with extra ear buds in different sizes*good length of the wirecons:* red color might not suit for everyone* brand name could get off easily since it is printed\\n\", \"\\n  LONG TERM REVIEWI personally love these earphones and i had purchased these earphones on 16 july 2018 and i am writing this review on 6 nov 2019. I wanna tell you that these are the most durable earphones i have seen.. take good care of these earphones(when use are done using them keep them safely)  my suggestion don't share your earphones bcz people usually don't take earphones seriously they just throw them here and there and earphones end up getting damaged. Ok so the earphones are still working best like they were on the day one.. no issues like voice is high on left or low on right NOTHINGG!! INFACT base lovers don't read further just buy it.. I bought it for 800 and now its tooooooo cheap.. AND i Don't know that for how much time i will have them because they're still working like before...\\n\", \"\\n  The Jbl C100SI earphone is having good sound quality. It's nice to listen to music on cellphone or watch movies on Pc with this earphone. Bass is sufficient since this is not a woofer or speaker. I have been using it for past 5 months and there is no problem. Better buy from sellers who have good ratings.\\n\", '\\n  This is a good product to buy. I have been using this for a month now. The earphones are working perfectly. The sound quality is not distorted even if you increase volume to its peak. Noise cancellation is also good in this earphone. Bass quality is awesome. You can experience why JBL is so much valued and respected when it comes to earphones!Worth buying, value for money. The look is also great as it comes in black color. Also, the ear plugs are designed to fit in comfortably. Love it.\\n', '\\n  Being a music fanatic, i love plugging in the earphones and forgetting about the world! And these earphones enable me to do so!! The noise cancellation is upto the mark. However, if the environment around you is way too loud, some noise might seep in. The bass and surround sound is equally superb. The wires look sensitive and so it might demand a little bit of care, which is true for most electronic products anyway. An added advantage is the reliable brand name and the warranty period.Sennheiser cx180 II too is a good product in this price range but the absence of a mic is a big disadvantage.Overall, as per my experience jbl c100si is the best earphone in this price range!\\n', \"\\n  I'm using it from 24 th sept, 2018. After almost 1.8 year I am reviewing it. In my opinion it's best earphone I 've ever had. I'm using it 1.8 years roughly. Nothing happened. But now it's mic nearer wire has broken. No it's not JBL 's fault. It's only my fault. Now come to sound quality1) Crystal clear sound2) Not extra bass, rich bassNow come to design1) Light weight2 ) wire is more durable3) mic is on right side( preferred by me)Cons:Chose your perfect size of bud , if not you can't wear this for long timeOne more thing I bought it for 649 but in big indian sale in October it's price comes to 549So try to buy this that time, otherwise you will pay extra money. I request all buyers to write their price of buying. It became easy for new buyer to buy in correct price.Overall good earphone 👍🏼\\n\", '\\n  Writing this review after 15 months of usage!Guys these are the best earphones that you can ever buy! I listen to rock music predominantly..and I even use these earphones on my ps4.. they delivEr what they promise!These earphones even got wet once in the washing machine and are still working fine!Imma be reordering them for the rest of my life lolCheers!\\n', \"\\n  If you are planning to buy these earphones then keep in mind that you should handle these with care.Material quality is as follows1.headphone jack is gold plated and fits well2.Headphone jack has a flexible tail which is small in size..A larger can do a good job3.wire from jack to junction is thick and good quality4.earbuds are rich plastic and fits well in ear.5.Mic is best in class6.sound quality is smooth.bass and treable is balanced well.Not too noisy..You can listen to almost every beat--------Verdict------Overall considering the price point and if you are going to handle these with care..Then go for these earphones.I don't have any issues with sound quality but I am planning to buy a headphone pouch to increase the life of cable.\\n\", '\\n  Very bad experience from a brand like JBL.The earphones look cheap and wire quality is very ok type.There is vibration while talking on phone.Sometimes it gives shock in ear yes shoc if it is shaken.Only sound quality is ok.Heavy cost cutting by JBL the earbud is too small.And last but not the least MADE IN CHINA.\\n', '\\n  Pros....1) good sound .... can give all effects if you are playing PUBG on mobile....2)  Nicely connects Samsung models like J7,galaxy tab A 8 or auxus phone....Con....1) eats wax from your ear daily.... so good for your ear but... have to clean it daily ( as per your usage) on a softest cloth available in your home....\\n', \"\\n  This is one of the best sounding earphones in this price range, i must say that I'm very much impressed by sound quality and the bass it had offered. But this product doesn't last long for sure, coz I'm using this product since 2months and the cable had broken at 3.5mm connector's place coz of simple bend that i did when i put my phone connected with earphones into the pocket for some 3-4days while i was walking. So if u dont put ur phone in your pocket with earphones connected then it wont break for some time, and if u want best sounding experience u could buy this.So I recommend this product on the basis of music quality and dont recommend on durability and reliability.... Thank u\\n\", '\\n  I used c150si, c200si, and c100si... I love JBL sound.. c150si was vary amazing because it had both good treble and deep bass and long lasted more than 1.5 yrs, c200si using currently it has medium bass and high treble, and regularly using C100SI and it has medium bass and medium treble and now after six months first time ever right earpiece stopped.. I am going to replace it from JBL as it is in warrenty...\\n', '\\n  wow, amazing sounds like i am in heaven but less than senheiser cx, now in may 2019my headphones the left one got damaged,now i am listening with one.After one year the headphone got totally damaged and after one replacement from the jbl store it is now replaced by a new one.now today on 5th june 2020 I have totally rejected the speaker and headphones.I wondered how JBL is so cheap.So JBL is not a better one.Now shifting to senheizer\\n', \"\\n  Firstly, the product was packed well.The earphones not only look very appealing but also have a sturdy built. The sound quality is the most important parameter for judging earphones and honestly, I'm quite happy with it. The bass quality is pretty decent.They also sent me size caps which makes putting them on easy, unlike most earphones I've tried.The buttons make listening music easy too.The mic quality is good and you can attend calls easily with these. In my opinion, these are the best budget earphones.\\n\", '\\n  Sound quality is descent. Better then the bass boosted earphones. But if you like bass to be very prominent then this is not for you. I loved the overall experience. Although i use it with extreme caution as the wire is very flimsy. And that takes away peace of mind. The treble is kind of high at first experience as i migrated from another brand. Or maybe it is really high. At high volume the sound becomes noise and starts to hurt my ears. In about 60 - 70% volume the sound quality is great. Instrument separation is also quite good and the vocals are clear.\\n', \"\\n  I used the earphones sparingly for about 6 days and one side stopped working out of nowhere. I am absolutely flabbergasted. As someone who has used many high end earphones, I was keen to try what JBL had to offer with this relatively cheap pair. Unfortunately, I am completely disappointed. I wouldn't even let my dog listen to the the disgusting quality of the earphones. There is almost no bass, and it performs even worse at higher frequencies. After this experience, I am more despondent with JBL and their ability to deliver on good earphones. Do not buy this product even if it is the only choice.\\n\"], 'url': 'https://www.amazon.in/JBL-C100SI-Ear-Headphones-Black/dp/B01DEWVZ2C/ref=sr_1_10_mod_primary_lightning_deal?dchild=1&fst=as%3Aoff&pf_rd_i=6308595031&pf_rd_m=A1K21FY43GMZF8&pf_rd_p=2c2b4d9e-f15e-4cf3-8e5c-acf68c668c41&pf_rd_r=80WR7NYVY11014AWK7F7&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_t=101&qid=1601263641&refinements=p_85%3A10440599031&rnid=10440598031&rps=1&s=electronics&sbo=Tc8eqSFhUl4VwMzbE4fw%2Fw%3D%3D&smid=A14CZOWI0VEHLG&sr=1-10', 'category': 'Mobile', 'destination_urls': ['/Infinity-Glide-510-Headphone-Equalizer/dp/B0873JVK21/ref=bmx_1/262-2524235-9493934?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B0873JVK21&pd_rd_r=51b1fc2d-8764-4ec0-9ded-ea0d4a3938b3&pd_rd_w=HX7lU&pd_rd_wg=AMoZv&pf_rd_p=08abe11d-4ee5-46ca-8471-7bf18c53fc91&pf_rd_r=K6JCT1W72YQZ9FGCSE60&psc=1&refRID=K6JCT1W72YQZ9FGCSE60', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A09389662OEHLD4EFK0SS&qualifier=1602309520&id=5575391141735117&widgetName=sp_detail_thematic&url=%2Fdp%2FB0153BS048%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB0153BS048%26pd_rd_w%3DEXf0j%26pf_rd_p%3D719334a9-8cf4-4c2d-972b-46beedf42360%26pd_rd_wg%3DAMoZv%26pf_rd_r%3DK6JCT1W72YQZ9FGCSE60%26pd_rd_r%3D51b1fc2d-8764-4ec0-9ded-ea0d4a3938b3', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A024297933POFJV1RHMSP&qualifier=1602309520&id=7844802144420875&widgetName=sp_detail&url=%2Fdp%2FB073XGT189%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB073XGT189%26pd_rd_w%3Di8tJb%26pf_rd_p%3D1801b34c-8af9-42b5-8961-11f124edc99b%26pd_rd_wg%3DAMoZv%26pf_rd_r%3DK6JCT1W72YQZ9FGCSE60%26pd_rd_r%3D51b1fc2d-8764-4ec0-9ded-ea0d4a3938b3', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A09953792MUN8ZY28C3US&qualifier=1602309519&id=4225696192950439&widgetName=sp_detail2&url=%2Fdp%2FB07JVM2MSL%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1']}, {'_id': {'$oid': '5f815873aaa28c53dfe2b472'}, 'description': 'Redmi Note 9 (Pebble Grey, 4GB RAM 64GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display', 'price': '₹11,999', 'rating': '4.2 out of 5 stars', 'review_count': '8,742', 'reviews': ['\\n  Dont buy.. after 10 to.15 mins gaming phone lagging too much\\n', '\\n  Good phoneDecent look and looks stylishCamera and battery quality are super goodGood phone in this range 👍But delivery service is not good\\n', \"\\n  Not good phone stopped working after some time so i didn't suggest you this...\\n\", \"\\n  Here my product review after usage of 2 week.Pros:Design and built quality - superb.Display - Smoothness and view is very impressiveFinger print sensor and face unlock working  perfect.Rear camera - Good as considering the price.Ram management and multitasking - Just ok.

The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless .

However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide\\'s sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0\" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren\\'t many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that\\'s pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow.

I am suggesting it for you guys go for it\\n', '\\n  I\\'m aware that when your colour mode is set to auto, the contrast can get really high in sunlight to make the display easier to see. I\\'m personally not a fan of this feature, so I turned it off on my previous phone.Now I\\'ve got the Redmi Note 9  with MIUI 11, but even after setting the colours to default, the contrast still changes in sunlight. What\\'s worse, it tends to \"spas out\" when in a car for instance. It seems that the sensor/software is confused whether or not the contrast should be increased or not, so in the end the display starts to almost flash by continuously lowering and upping the contrast.I\\'ve tried restarting the phone, and turning the auto colour feature on and off. The problem still persists. Not sure if this is a bug or not. And if it\\'s not a bug, is there a way to turn the feature off completely?\\n', '\\n  Very best smartphone under the budget segments with best camera, performance, display and battery backup\\n', '\\n  Camera is Not Good.Photo Yello type.not Captured original Color.\\n', '\\n  I would like to review the redmi note note 9First prosPrimary Camera GoodRam management  betterDisplay Good128 GB internal memory goodApps are working butter smoothType C portConsSecondary camera very worst.

It\\'s just marketing tricks to release in schedule time and given configuration.I have motorola phone, using it from two years. With 42mp camera. That resolution is far better than thus redmi.I suggest don\\'t purchase redmi.\\n', '\\n  This product is made in China, even though Amazon claims that it is made in India.

Which is not worthy at all. Performance of the chipset is not good. For this price we can better move on to M series which have a better display.Pros:Camera quality is good.Fast charge is good.Cons:Display is not as good as compared to other phones in this same segmentHeating up when playing gamesBattery back up is just ok. It stands for 1.5 days for normal usage.\\n', '\\n  The phone is annoyingly slow. It says 4GB processor but if was easily beaten by some older 2GB processor phones. 48mega pixel camera is for name sake. A Samsung/ Moto /OnePlus 20odd megapixel camera is better than this phone. Highly disappointed in this Redmi phone. Battery charging speed seems to be a decade behind 3 hours required for full charge c30% charge per hour..\\n', \"\\n  I am having both realme 6i and redmi note 9.I must say,always go for note 9.Realme 6i battery is really a shit.its draining more quickly when compared to note9.This is due to its 90hz display.Also there are heating issues while charging in realme  6i.Redmi note 9 is better in camera on good light conditions when compared to realme6i.Moreover realme  6i comes with 18 watt in box charger and redmi note 9 comes with 22.5 watt in box.even though real me 6i supports 30watt charging ,who's gonna buy that 30 watt charger that costs 1,400 rs.When coming into screen protection realme6i comes with an older version of gorilla glass whereas redmi note 9 comes with latest corning gorilla glass 5 (both camera and screen are protected).There are chances for real me 6i camera to get scratches as it is not protected using gorilla glass whereas note 9' s camera is protected with corning gorilla 5 glass.Final words: if you really worry about battery life then never ever go for realme 6i.A feature called 90 hz display in realme 6i drains it battery quickly.Its better to describe realme  6i as 'fast draining phone' rather than 'fast charging phone'.Guys don't believe in reviewers words as they say good review in favour of the mobile company which gives them better amount.Its better to ask your friends who brought this phone rather than watching review videos.\\n\", '\\n  Received phone yesterday. First impression is ok ok. Phone case should have been given transparent. It comes in grey shade so overrides phone color. Observed little lags in some applications. First battery charge took 4 hours for 10 to 95. Phone which supports 22.5W charging only accepts 18W. Doesnt make sense. Since this is budget phone dont expect too much but atleast battery charging issue should be fixed.Note on Amazon Delivery - Considering the ongoing situation, I can undestand Amazon prefer for contactless delivery. But delivery person didnt call me at the time delivery. He directly handed my shipment to security. When I reached customer care, I was pointed that, I had received message and mail about delivery. But I was not satisfied with the answer, since I was expecting call from delivery person for some reason. These days I feel Amazon Customer Support has lost the friendliness.\\n', '\\n  You can play pubg in high graphics !!Battery backup is good...Display is awesome !!!Camera is awesome !!!Speaker sound is nice !Nice deal for 12k\\n', \"\\n  After the 8 days of delivery phone's screen pickup black and nothing was happened when I reboot the phone then it was doing properly functioning but sometime later that problem also faced by me and main thing is that it is made in China phone which I have got and mention in the box made in China and battery backup not good at all compared to other phones please replace this item\\n\", \"\\n  Very very wrost product from AmazonI purchased this product and I'm facing many problems1.

By 10:30pm that is before going to bed at night, I checked the buttery ℅ & it was 41%. When I checked it on morning by 5:30am after waking up, battery % was showing 32%.Without using the phone, 10℅ charge was gone within 7hrs. And also the super fast charging is useless. The phone takes 2.5hrs to charge from 0% to 100℅.Another weak point is that, it is MADE IN CHINA.☹️\\n\", \"\\n  Didn't like it\\n\", '\\n  Updating my review after 22 daysPros :1. Battery -5000mAh2.

But, if you select 48MP and took a photo, it is very good.Charging - Super fast, it took less than an hr from 20% - full charge.Weight - When you have case on it, you will feel something we are holding. Of-course every mobile will weigh, when you put the case on it.Performance - Since 2 days I am using it, it's really fast and want to observe more to write about it more.Display - it's large and very clear. Its an edge-to-edge screen and even we can change the settings of display to reduce the display size.Overall, if you are looking for best phone under 12K INR, blindly you can go for it.\\n\", \"\\n  \\xa0I bought this in the sale and was very happy that I got in offer price, it worked very good the day we received but from next day we experienced wifi connectivity issue (wifi connects and disconnects by itself, I had done couple of phone resets but the issue didn't resolve & i raised the issue with Amazon customer service and they appointed mobile inspection service the next day. A person came and inspected but couldn't resolve and updated the issue as it is and same day received a call from the Amazon customer service and told they will replace with a new phone and received a replace but this time also we experienced the same issue, and now we are waiting for the person who will come for inspection to check the issue. It was the same and we asked for refund and refunded at last. Thank you Amazon. If this was the issue with Flipkart they would not refund and tell us to got to the service center.

For 11 mins usage battery drained off from 66% to 64% with WIFi On. But not used any kind of internet consuming application. Just done some navigation in the phone. Software is not tested properly as there are lot of graphical glitches while using the phone. Hope in next UI update it will be fixed.\\n', '\\n  Nice product short range multi functioning at a instance with no lag ..performance above average .....\\n', '\\n  Everything is best in this phone according to the price and its the best in this budget. The battery lasts for 2days with medium usage. It has 22.5 W charger in the box but supports only 18W. The Charing speed is not so impressive. The cameras are very nice and have improved more after software updates. Gaming performance is decent in this price. The user experience has improved more after MIUI 12 update and there are no banned apps. Overall I recommend it to everyone.\\n', '\\n  Camera stopped working after inserting sim card. Amazon delayed my order 5 days late and delivered it 2nd sep which was supposed to deliver on 28th Aug. And replacement window closed on 5th sep.

It is the same design that Redmi Note 9 Pro and Redmi Note 9 Pro Max features. Back of the phone has a glossy finish making it reflective. Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 comes in three colour options: Pebble Grey, Arctic White, and Aqua Green. The review unit we got was the Pebble Grey colour variant. The phone looks good and sturdy, and will not disappoint you in terms of design.  You will also see a rectangular-shape cut out on the rear side housing the camera bump along with the fingerprint scanner. LED flash is placed beside the camera system. To the right side of the phone are the volume control buttons along with the power button. The SIM card tray is placed at the left side. Redmi Note 9 offers 2+1 card slots -- one for microSD card and two for SIM card each.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 is equipped with 3.5mm headphone jack placed at the bottom edge. The phone comes with a USB Type-C charger. The charging port is also placed at the bottom along with speaker grills and a microphone. On the top edge of the phone is the IR blaster.  The smartphone features a 6.53-inch punch-hole display with 1080x2340 FHD+ resolution. The punch-hole housing the front camera is placed at the top-right corner, thus it hardly obstruct the viewing experience on Redmi Note 9. The display is a strong point of the phone. It provides sharp colours with adequate brightness. Viewing angles are good too.Despite its glossy back, the phone offers a firm grip. The smartphone feels sturdy and durable and can be easily used with a single hand.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 9: PerformanceRedmi Note 9 comes powered by MediaTek Helio G85 octa-core processor with a maximum frequency of 2.0GHz, a GPU frequency of 1000MHz, and up to 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM. There is a 4GB RAM variant of the phone as well. The handset comes in two storage options: 64GB and 128GB. The MediaTek processor can easily handle day-to-day usage without giving you much to complain about.Considering, Redmi Note 9 is a budget phone, our hopes were not much high about the speed and performance of the device. The loading speed of the apps was reasonably good. Switching between multiple apps was easy. Gaming experience too will not be a disappointment. However, there were heating issues with the device after prolonged gaming or long streaming hours. But again, that’s acceptable at the price point.  Xiaomi has packed Android 10 with a layer of MIUI 11 on the top in the Redmi Note 9 phone. As with other Xiaomi phones, this device too comes with much pre-installed bloatware. These include apps like the Mi Credit, Helo, Mi Community, Zili and more. Some of the apps have already been banned by the Indian government. One can always uninstall them as per their own choice. What struck us is that the phone suggests you download a few more apps even during the setup process. But that again is an individual’s choice to install or not.Moving on, the phone’s UI is typical of any Redmi phone. If you are using a Redmi phone, you may find it easy to use the phone simply because of the familiarity. Also, you get spam notifications on the device.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 comes with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and Face Unlock technology for security and privacy of the device. Both worked well for us. The unlocking speed with both these security features was acceptable and just to the phone’s price.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9: CameraIn continuation of the trend these days, Xiaomi has introduced a quad lens camera system at the back with the Redmi Note 9. The phone offers a 48MP primary rear camera paired with three other sensors- a wide-angle lens, a macro lens and a depth lens. Again, there is not much new about the camera app and its UI. However, the company has added a separate Documents mode to Redmi Note 9 which can be used to scan important documents and papers. Considering the CamScanner app is no longer available, this is an important addition.The 48MP camera does justice to the object being captured. It is able to retain details and true colours more or less. However, the noise creeps in when you use the wide-angle lens. The sensor offers 8MP Ultra wide sensor with 118-degree field-of-view. Photos clicked were low in quality and lack detail.\\n', '\\n  Powerful Gaming processor.

This issue is very strange as it displays connected to wifi but no internet. This is very weird.Looks like this issue is with all redmi phones as my redmi note 4 shows similar strange behavior. Be careful if you use wifi more than mobile data.\\n', \"\\n  Amazon is advertising this product as an ace, but the reality is far from what they say for the quality. Within a month from buying, the device starts to hang miserably including many other minor issues. The other issue I have been facing is the wifi connectivity. Wifi doesn't works efficiently unless the device is put on airplane mode, and on top of all this, no response from the company. I contacted amazon, but they deny to bear any responsibility. They just wanna sell the products, but with minimal to no cover for any faults/damages. SHAME on AMAZON.THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH BUYING.\\n\", \"\\n  Fantastic phone.  Value for money! great battery life (I don't see Youtube or do gaming on it, so the battery lasts 3 full days when fully charged).  48 MP camera gives great pictures, crisp, sharp and right colors.

No heating problems even if  you use talk for long or while charging.Pros - Great design, camera, processor, sleek, easy to hold, fast charging, no lags, no heating problems.Cons - None as of yet.\\n\", '\\n  Amazon advertising made in India and send Made in China phone.

If your main aim is battery and display this is a best choice. Camera is average to decent that you can expect in this price segment.

Neon green colour looks very nice.Didn't find any con after listening to 12-15 different genres songs, call quality is also good.Go for it in this price range (450-500).Though I received an open box but its not related to product quality. 1 less star for delivery and packing.\\n\", \"\\n  Worst earphones I have ever bought in my life.

Better investment.\\n\", '\\n  This is the true earphone to connect you to nirvana not for longer times because it starts pain in ear after a long time continuous use.Bass- in the price of 450, bass is terrible. You will get powerful bass than you expect.Sound- if a headphone has poor sound, it is not a headphone. But this one has the sound that will blow your mind totally.Noice cancellation- in the price range of 400-500 no brand will give you perfect noice cancellation headphones, but in boat bassheads, there is noice cancellation but not so good.Overall- if you have 500 rs. And you are searching for beast headphone in you budget and if you are reading reviews, and if you are reading this one, i am telling you go for it without hesitation beacuse after a long research on 2 shopping sites i found thi product best in my price range.(i bouggt it for 450).\\n', \"\\n  Just overdid it on the bass. There is virtually no treble. The singers voice just gets muted. Good for pew pew Hindi, pop, hip-hop type songs. I guess that's why they are sold in India. Not for metalheads! Also the eargrips are uncomfortable after long use. Needless addition. Durability I will comment a few months later. But for the price can't complain. It's no Bose.\\n\", \"\\n  If you want durable earphone, protected from sweat, water. Go for this.Build quality: Very good form factor, braided cable with waterproof coating. Eartips are comfortable and fits nicely, looks durable.Sound: Boat earphone, hence Bass rich, treble and mids could have been better (as I listen music in studio monitors, so I felt, not a big issue)Downsides: Wire seems very durable, but not too thick. Could've been thicker. Extra eartips only 2 small and 2 mediums. Couldve been provided more.Overall you can surely take this if you badly need waterproofing and durability, otherwise 225/152/162 has slightly better sound. But this has volume control keys, thats a plus point.\\n\", \"\\n  Best for me. If you fall in the middle category, where you don't want the best of the best earphones but also don't want the worst, go for this.Earbuds don't fall from my ears! My ears are kind of weird. Like Amir Khan (lol). (I have had a bad past with regards to this with my previous earphones).Bass is gooood. Sound clarity is also good. Some experts may say the vocal clarity is overshadowed by the bass, but I am okay with that.The clip is very useful in preventing the earbuds from falling. I clip it on my collar.The cable strength is also good. The cable got pulled twice by accident, and nothing happened to the earphones.The mic is also good. I use these earphones to listen to music, watch YouTube, calling, send and listen to voice notes, etc.Best. Cheers!Don't think too much :)\\n\", '\\n  This is a product review after using it for straight 2 hours since it just got delivered today.What an improvement firstly from the boat bassheads 225.Now, i dont know what the other negative reviews are about since i personally did not find any issue whatsoever with these infact i am delighted by it.If you are looking a for a good wired earphone and dont want to spend much then this would be the best budget earphone in the market right now.Firstly speaking of the body it is plastic and not metallic and so it has become lighter than the previous bassheads so much that after using it for 2 straight hours i almost forgot i had them put on. I just felt the wire could have been a bit thicker but dont forget the wire is braided and coated with a rubber like material which should resolve that dilemma.These come with ear hooks which to my surprise were so comfortable. I usually hate ear hooks cause they hurt after a while but these are just so soft and fit right in.Moving on the main purpose and the bigger question \"BASS\".I would say it\\'s perfect.The sound quality is so very crisp and clear.BASS is in the right spot and according to me you dont need anymore.You may hear from other reviewers the BASS is not as good as the previous bassheads please understand it depends on what kind of music you listen and mostly the KBPS which is kilo bits per second. The higher the kbps the better the sound including bass and treble.The loudness is great almost deafening at the highest volume.To check noise cancellation (although these earphones dont say noise cancellation) I made a few phone calls and asked if they heard any background noise and they said they could hear little to nothing of whats happening in the background. Now ofcourse this is in a normal environment and may not cancel the traffic sounds or a loud background noise.The added advantage is the IPX4 sweat and water resistance (you dont find this feature in most wired earphones atleast not in this price range) which is great specially when you work out or when you are jogging or talking a walk. Although since it is wired you will find discomfort and so may want to get wireless bluetooth earphones instead.So heres how i would rate it on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 being the highest and 1 being the lowest.Price: 5Build Quality: 4.5 ( Only cause i think the wire could have been a little thicker)Loudness: 5Call Quality: 5Bass: 5 (The bass is just perfect if any more bass than this you\\'d better be putting your ears on a  loudspeaker).Hope this clarifies your doubts about this product.All in all yet another great product from BOAT and you wont regret the purchase.\\n', '\\n  It is second day of my usage. I went for run with this ear phones. They claim to be sweat proof but after 2 minutes of run my mic and volume button are giving false signals. Automatically music gets change and volume goes to zero all of sudden. I think this is because of sweat and mic is mis-operating.I think we should not call earphones sweat protection if any of the system is friendly for sweat. completely disappointed with product.\\n', '\\n  Great product...Great sound ....And got it on deal price 449...In this price, they give volume control with great sound quality. ....must buy product\\n', \"\\n  Okay, some people may differ but in my opinion the bass is too much. So much that it overpowers all the other aspects of the song. If you're into EDM where it's basically bass and.... just bass, then I guess it's a good fit. But if you want to hear other genre of music, then I would advise not to buy this product. The bass is just painful and I had to return the product and buy Sennheiser CX180 instead. It's too good for the price range.\\n\", '\\n  Earler ive used jbl, philips, sony and mi earphones. But this stands top of all.  And i personally call it baap of all in this price segment.  Even 1500 segment of jbl and sanheiser.  The moment i plugged in these earphones and played muqabla.. I just stood up from my chair.... As well as all my hair on hands.. What else i can say... Just go for it.. Please dont search for anything else and waste your time.  Ive done a lot of review. Sent back few earphones coz of some problem.  But this is all rounder.\\n', '\\n  bass is better than boat 225, sennheiser cx180, sennheiser cx213 and sony mdr EX15AP. also tangle free, at this price of 549, it is worth of money.drawback is your you cant use this product for long time........\\n', \"\\n  In this price range it's the best option. If you have higher budget it's not the best. The problems I faced are high bass at higher volume levels, destroying the song... Recommend listening at 65 to 75 for best results (pretty good clarity at this level). Next is usage time after like 1to 2 hours, ears start to pain and becomes uncomfortable.Pro's1. Best fit, it will not fall out.2. HD sound at approx 70 percent volume.3. Mic is good not the best. Manageable at this price range4. Noise cancellation good blocks 90 percent of the backround noise.Overall best in its price range. Don't expect much, you see it's not a Bose.\\n\", \"\\n  Very flimsy! Not meant for runners, sports or even walking for that matter.The wiring inside the mic assembly where other buttons like volume controls are placed was shorting causing volume commands to be activated on slight movement of the cord around the mic module. Buy it if you still want to experiment and don't mind loosing your money. Keep the packaging for at least till the return window in case you buy it.\\n\", \"\\n  I purchased this boat hadset, initially it was working excellent but after 2 months, I don't know whether it's a design issues or might be other problem, I contacted service center of boat. They denied to replace my headphone, staff said me that it's a special cricketer editon so I need to complain via online from the boat website and I registered a complete raised ticket but still now no reply. Poor service. till date no reply from  BOAT. kindly think before buying boat products.\\n\", '\\n  I was confused whether I should return or not.  I have done the sound test on this boat earphone and I compared with JBL. I tried to see the difference in the same music.  I am going to do sound test on Vivo earphones.  I tried to use both earphones on vivo s1 phone.Pros (why you should buy)1. Good bass(bass lover should like it)2. Awesome wire quality.  Tangle free, durable and beautiful.3. 1 year warranty4.You can remove the sports cap if you are not using for sportsCons(not to buy)1. Treble is 0. No treble.  Bass treble should have balance.  Sound quality decreased.  It looks someone is pressing the neck of the singer.2. There is no surround sound.  The earphones with surround sound gives pleasure.  The left music should play in left earphone and right in right earphone. It is lacking.3.if boat Will work on above two points.  This earphon will be awesome.4. The earphone is not comfortable for long time music.  You have to remove the cap.  The boat should release half earphones like apple and vivo. The earphone is comfort after removing cap.\\n', \"\\n  It was just an Awesome sets of earphone with accurate frequency point to listen a song ... Just replacing the ear caps, change the tune & frequency for the listener ...In small pair of ear caps you can hear pure Crystal Clear voice & only it focus on voiceIn medium pair of ear caps u get a sense of Equalize bass, drums, voice (as per song u have/make)In large if it will fit in your ear it will give u complete sense of isolation of song like an large hallIt work like as per a high-Quality headset become sounds as per there change of Padss Cusans ... It's awesome to have it ... Try it u goonna make sure it sense something else in every different ear pads\\n\", \"\\n  The overall sound quality is good, this is a good sports earphone for the price, but you get another earphone that's far superior than these, at the same price. They are called Leaf Bolt.Leaf Bolt's sound quality and bass is far superior than Boat Bassheads 242. And I have worn them in showering rain multiple times and they have remained absolutely fine due to their water resistance tech. Go for Leaf Bolt instead if you want overall better experience and comfort as well. Or go for Realme Buds 2 or Boat Bassheads 225 if you are obsessed with earth shattering bass for this price range.\\n\", '\\n  Build quality was ok. Initially bass was okish. But after audio tuning it felt great. Buttons functioning were gud. Might feel pain in ears if using for long tym due to \"secure ear lock\" not coz of ear piece.Absence of Gold coated Jack felt a bit down.Overall, a totally value for money product at such price point and a real steal deal offer ;-)\\n', '\\n  The built quality is too bad. Cheap plastic quality. Sound quality is decent and above average. I got this for Rs 399 during lightning deal but definitely not a Rs 450 or above product for the quality of plastic used.\\n', \"\\n  Before these earphones, I used the basic Samsung earphones which were 5 years old.And I am writing this review after 3 days of usage,daily for 3-4 hours.Pros:  1- Crystal clear & loud sound.  5/52- Amazing bass.  5/53-Call quality is fine. 4/54- The wires are braided which make them more durable.  5/5One of the most amazing features is that you get sound control buttons in this earphones which work as a charm.Cons :1- After continuous use for 45-60 mins, they cause pain in ears.2- They are MADE IN CHINA.  I didn't know it before.Edit: After daily usage of almost 1 week, the right earplug is not working properly and they are causing hell lot of pain and itchiness on the ear.I am reducing the rating from 4 stars to 1. Also I have applied for replacement.I really wish, somehow refund would be possible, as I don't want to waste 500 Rs.\\n\", '\\n  The High and Mids (Treble) are crystal clear. Lyrics can be distinguished. The lows(bass) are not that thumpy as they should be. Even with an equalizer the bass is not crispy, you can just feel a little not enjoy. Bass:- 3/5Overall:- Affordable at 449, comes with extra buds, wires look durable(will update after month use), volume button works well\\n', \"\\n  Till now I never reviewed any negatives about the product.But this one is very worst product made by boat.sound quality is like 50/-rs street shop earphones .High sounds are like gun firing,bgm,etc is like watching movies on Kaarbon 2000r phone speakersThis is worstFrom past 3years am buying boat earphone and headphones all that was worth for more than that price But this 242 is not even worth for 50rsI don't know whether it's boat product or clone product\\n\", '\\n  by look and sound it was goodBut it has a very poor quality of wire which has been a problem of BOat.This is my 3rd boat earphone which one side is stopped working... replacement earphone quality is also of same quality usually lasts for 1-2 months only.it has zero noise cancellation dont think about taking calls using it\\n', '\\n  Quality is not up to the mark. Used with my moto one power as well as HP elitebook . Very uncomfortable noises . Sometimes hessy unwanted noises . Not very comfortable in fittings too.Now I need to buy boat 225 . I had it before and much better than this one .Only plus point is volume control and start stop option. This is working fine.I need to refund money and go for another product but only return option is available. I already returned one product but same problem in returned product.Bab buy.. I need refund of money and go for another boat product.\\n', \"\\n  Don't buy this model of Boat..It is useless, no sound quality, no bass..I really wonder how customers are giving wrong feedback..I have been using Boat products for almost 4 years now, but this one is a waste.. Don't buy this model of boat earphone.Aside, shame to the seller....he is sending used product...the package was opened and used..\\n\", \"\\n  I was waited for the black and red version of it but i couldn't get that. So i have to stick with sprit lime.  Before gst hike this same product available at 400rs in offer period but it is only available at 499rs even at offer time.Pros1. Good looking2. It has volume button as well as play, pause button3. it has got 3 ear tips for your convenience.4. It also has clip and holder for ear5. It has ipx4 ratingCons1. The play pause button sometimes act as next button sometimes work as play pause confusing mechanism2. It holds perfect but i didn't use that white colour holder if you use that you may feel pain after long time.3. I have used it for gaming continuously for long time but i did gave any issue but i have used it for my online training for one day i had pain in my ears i don't know why.4. The price gets lower in atleast in offer time would be great .\\n\", '\\n  After using it for a month or two.. Let me figure this out for you1) Sound quality upto the mark2) Bass is balanced which i prefer neither too much or less3) Built quality and the extraa layering over the wire makes it more reliable.4) Unconventional plugs makes it glew to the ear drums pretty well.5) Comes with a warranty6) Price range is perfect for a colored headphones like these.The only thing they can do better is with the microphone and volume balance. sometimes its too low or too high but hey it could be a case with the phone I am using.\\n', \"\\n  1.Sound quality good, don't expect thumping sound of 10driver headphone.2. Fits excellent and also comfortable enough in the ears.3. Stay relaxed even if you're sweating, don't expect fighting rainfall.4. Looks good but not really tangle free.5. Noise cancellation decent but not great, though can't expect much in this price.6. Overall satisfactory.\\n\", \"\\n  It's a great product considering its price. Good built quality, Sounds is clear and amazing deep bass.Unfortunately the right side stopped working after 2mnths. I have written to info@imaginemarketingindia.com but didn't get any response. Very disappointed :(\\n\", '\\n  One side of these ear plugs stopped working within 3 weeks. The number that was written/given for the warranty related issues is not correct. No other way to contact the seller....Hope they will react now after seeing  my review.... Otherwise good product, only if it worked properly for some time.\\n', \"\\n  Worst sound. It's like someone is poking you with a needle in your ears. Great design but no use. Got ear pain within two days of using this. Sharp painful sound at higher volumes. Somehow managing with low volumes. Bad bass. Worthless.\\n\", \"\\n  These boat bassheads are an absolute steal for this price.I mainly purchased it for the mic,as it's closer unlike many other earphones and it's fulfilled it's purpose.They have a sporty look and a plastic build.The audio quality is outstanding ,and this is by far the best earphones I've had till now.The bass is punchy and the mistimes are well balanced as well.The noise cancellation on this is unreal.They're great for my workouts and sweatproof.Call quality is great and I've had no complains so far.Overall very satisfied with my purchase.Its sporty look might not be for everyone but performance wise it's great.\\n\", \"\\n  This is my review after using a month.Pros:- Easy fit- Good sound- Pretty good Noise cancellation- Provided a small clip to pin the wire to your shirt.Cons:- Can hear non stop for 40 minutes or a hour. then you can get slightly feel the pain. pain is good becasue it will notify to take rest for sometime :)Even though seller mentioned it is waterproof. but still i'm taking care of it by staying away from water and wiping the sweat often.You should buy it without second thought... Happy Purchase!\\n\", '\\n  Looking at lot of good reviews, I think the opinion probably differs with people.. Sound quality is definitely better than any low profile earphones, but bass quality seems to be so unnatural, boosted to much that gives pain in the ears.Pros: Ear piece stick to the ear comfortably, Sound quality is decent enough, call quality is goodCons: Boosted bass sound spoils the original music (some may like it) it hurts the ear drum in short time of listening to the songs. `This is the first day review, if my opinion change after some days of usage, will get back to change the rating.\\n', '\\n  My second Boat earphone is also stop working within three months. What is this, and there is no response from your side regarding my first earphone replacement from many days (ticket no. 1154217)You guys are not responsing about my complain, is this way to deal with your costumers. Your call center is not picking up call. You give warranty of your product and when I claim for warranty you stop responding me. I bought two earphones and both are not working.  bad product.... After three months of use it will show different types problems.. And there is no response from company when you go for warranty. I have two same earphones and within 3 months both are not working.\\n', \"\\n  I don't know if you are an audiophile or not but as far as I am concerned these are the one of the best high-quality stuff available online.though the sound is not as par as a 3k headphone, what do you expect in such a small price range?pros:* good fit perfect ear support* awesome colour* mic is also good* the jack is hard to pull as no ridges on it if hands are oilycons:* not tangle-free* dirt magnet* no velcro and case to keep safe* the pinch too big and ugly* lacks bass and the sound is high pitched\\n\", '\\n  Product is good. Sound is good. In short this is nice product. But as u now can see on the pictures this happened with me with this product. One side of earplug is automatically came out from its wire. & This is soo heartbroken.So all I want Plz replace this product, so I can enjoy my music. I am your regular customer.Hoping & waiting for a positive response from Amazon/boat India.Thanks\\n', '\\n  242 is not up to the mark. I already have Bass head 100 which is better than this one. Noice cancellation is not that much great. Only benefit I found is that it has inline mic with volume control.Good in bassTreble is above average but actually I found it a disturbing one compared to bass head 100.Fits in ear with ear clip.The additional clip for dress is also helpful.Good cord length and material is also good.Product wise it need improvement.Delivery and packing is fine.Thank you amazon\\n', \"\\n  So I'll be sharing my views about this earphone with you guys. So I'll be summing up my review in total of 3 points i.e. experience ‚ comparison and why you should buy it1) Experience : If I talk about my experience then I'll say that I have been using these boat earphones for 1 month and I haven't faced any issue yet ☺️ .  As the name itself suggests BASSheads they truly offers a very good bass . The mids and lows are also good. They are truly value for money.2) Comparison : As it's price is around 550 I don't think any other big brand provides any earphones in this price segment but if your budget is around 700 then definitely go for the jbl ones3)Why should you buy it : According to me around a price of 550 they are definitely one of the finest earphones . But one of the major reason why I brought these earphones is because of boAt not just because its a big brand but also of its warranty i.e. boAt provides doorstep return pickup of your earphones in ODISHA I don't know about any other state  So I would say if warranty matters you a lot then these boAt earphones are definitely for you .Pros1) Braided cable you don't have to worry about your cable anymore like I do 😅2) boAt offers wings which will never let the earphones come out if your ears 😋.3)Stylish and premium looking 😎.4) ipx4 water resistant 😃.5)You can use these earphones while lying on your bed or lounge these won't hurt 😉.Cons1) These are not the metal but plastic 😔Hope my review will help you choose your earphones :-)NOTE : boAt IS AN INDIAN BRAND (^^)(^^)\\n\", \"\\n  If you are buying it for listening to music and you are on a tight budget then you are good to go. But the Mic is absolutely awful. There is no concept called 'Noise Cancellation', the mic itself creates noise. But the 'Bass' is quite good. But the 3D sound effect is not good. The wire's build quality is good but the earphones seems quite cheap. Personally after using it for music and gaming, I will not recommend you to buy this for playing mobile games. But for casual purposes it's reliable.\\n\", '\\n  The product is an above average one and an advantage to the fame of BOATPros:- It has great brand package- Stylish design and best quality wires that can withstand all kinds of wear and tear- Best class noise cancellation- Sound quality is brilliant and provides above average bass.Cons:- The length of the wire/ cord is too much, so some may feel it uncomfortable as I do- The bass quality is not of the best quality, but on enabling the Dolby Atmos mode on certain mobile phones, it gets to the best version- The buttons may get pressed inwards/ damaged fast, but currently in good conditionOn the whole, go for it. Nice value for money product.\\n', '\\n  PUBG go for itBest for PUBGThe footsteps are super clearAmazing qualityBest for musicLoud and clearSuper comfortableBecause of that thing above the headphones it holdsNoise cancellation amazingSound amazingMIC quality amazingJust buy\\n', \"\\n  Very good product. Been using it since 6-7 months continuously. Very rough usage (while traveling in Mumbai local). Still its very durable, sound quality is not compromised at all. In 80% volume you won't feel any sound from outside. The rubber whites might be irritating to some but its easily detachable. Very good product in this price range.\\n\", '\\n  At first, I was sceptical about these earphones because these are very low cost for the features they offer. I was doubtful that the sound output might not be that great out of these earphones. But suprisingly these are exceptional earphones because of the fact that these have great sound output with features like splash resistant, have great noise cancellation, multimedia control buttons, mic, Nylon coated cables, and very reasonable price tag.Compared to the expensive rival brands like JBL and Sennheiser, these offer more value.I bought these mainly to be used for workout sessions but now these are my primary earphones for all types of media consumption. Sound output like Highs (treble) and Mids (voice) are very well balanced and has punchy low end (bass).Although at start one may feel that these earphones are a bit uncomfortable during long hours but with time one will get used to them easily.The only down side I feel about these earphones is that they have cheaper plastic feel to it. But considering the pricing you can not expect more. Although the plastic is sturdy enough if you use them carefully.\\n', \"\\n  It works properly for just 3 months after it bacames worst than any thing else after claiming my warranty it took to clear 1 month. Even after I got some others used earphone which is also not working. I'm fed up with this earphone now I'm using just for listening songs it isn't working in any call. So while purchasing read review.\\n\", \"\\n  Sound :Best earphone....as it give a loud sound.....n the bass of the earphone is really awesome...as I was before using boat bassheads 100 earphone n after using boat  bassheads 242 I can say that it it really a better as it's sound n bass is awesome.Bulid:Quality of the earphone is also good as it has an extra coating outside.\\n\", '\\n  After purchase with in 2 days the right side of earpiece stopped working then I replaced the product so please be aware not so good also mike quality is very bad. You can only replace the product with same earphones with in 7 days of purchase but no option of return.\\n', \"\\n  I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars. I'm giving it 4 because it's the best in its range i'd say.But there are downsides, the treble is very weak and the bass is overshadowing everything else. It doesn't produce the clearest of sounds because of this. The ear hooks are very uncomfortable after an hour of use.Buy this if you're on a tight budget, I'd suggest spending 200-300 more and get Sony MDR or Sennheiser CX 180.I wished boat balanced out everything for a better experience rather than going all out on bass. Not the best for pure listening experience because of weak trebles etc.\\n\", '\\n  So after using for 6months my review is hereBass 8/10Sound clearity 9/10Noise cancellation 7/10Durability 9/10Build quality 9/10So for this price range, this one is better option.Dont hesitate to thumbs up if you liked the review\\n', \"\\n  Sound Quality- WorseI mean not good at all. sounds like 50 rupees earphone. very cheapNoise Cancellation- AvarageNoise cancellation is ok ok only not too good for this price range.Bass Quality- Too worsehonestly i purchase this product for good bass bus seriously this earphone not ment for bass lover. very BAKWAAAAS BassI think this item price should be under 150 rupees. worse product.Boat I don't hope that... really disappointed 😩But i sold this product to other person living nearby with a loss of 100 rupeesand ordered Boat 225 Megnam driver which i used earlier.😂😂\\n\", '\\n  First of all I am true fan of boAt. This product was my 3rd purchase. Coming precisely to the point. The sound i experienced in this earphone was not natural as i expected, when i firstly heard audio from it, the word that came in my mind was \"Electronic, it sounds like metal instrument being played in my ears\", meaning that there was no naturality. Too much bass making mids awkward, treble was high. After all i retuned immediately and purchased boAt bassheads 100 which sounds much better. I am using 100 from 2 years and i am satisfied with that.Dissappointed with boAt bassheads 242.\\n', \"\\n  Warranty of this product is not useful after buying this product 3-4 months later in one side and Mic not working after dead I made in warranty ticket then they picked off from my phone and deliver to the Mumbai head head office of boat service centre and then while I checking the status of my ticket then it is written that replacement product issued now it's been one month over and I didn't get my product so their service is very bad don't buy these products otherwise the product quality is very good but their service is very very poor\\n\", \"\\n  I am typing this review after 2 weeks I had used this product and my personal experience was it's not comfortable to wear after one hour. Sound quality is sharp and good but I notice it get reduce after one week of usage product packaging and build is quite attractive and its water resistant and good for daily use.Conclusion : i will say please don't go for this earphone they are good but you can get better ear phones and some point this ear phone design is annoying and it's not comfortable to wear after certain time you will get this point when you use this ear phone for after that its start irritating and itching in ears I will suggest you better go for different option 😉\\n\", '\\n  Sound quality: Bass is balance little extra, feel good thumping effectTreble is balanced also and cleared with Crispi clear sound,All small instrument sound details can identify it is goodEnough loud sound at 100% volumeFitting in ear is very good and 80%noise cancellationsWire is very good quality, looks durable with extra coated ...Overall worth to music lovers as well caller ...Fitting excellent not fall down on bike also.\\n', '\\n  Nice headphone colour may vary slightly from the page,wire bulit quality and sound,bass everything ies awesome.The box contains:1-Earphone, 1 year warranty card,extra ear tips one clip and a leaflet... Packing quality some what poor...\\n', '\\n  I have been using mi earphones from past 2 years and they are surprisingly quite durable and lasting but they didn’t sound so good. So i went for boats this time as i already have boat rockerz 400 and boat is getting more and more better in quality and sound. so its been quite a good time i have been using this and they are pretty good. This are awesome they dont fall out of your ear due to the silicon attachment with it. As it name says bass heads they are actually good with it bass. The audio is crisp and perfect, i would recommend them over bassheads 225. Overall quality is nice and perfect at this price point. If you are looking to get a good pair then give this a shot. You wont regret it\\n', \"\\n  Another class product from BoAt.Hey Boatheads looking for bass, sweatproof Budget Headphones, well this is your answer to all your requirments.Bass 5/5Fit (In Ear) 5/5Sweatproof 5/5Tangled (Rarely and easily undoable)Use it perfect music app and Equalizer, you won't be disappointed.\\n\", '\\n  I brought Boat 242 earphones last week.. Just in a week Right side speaker of earhone stopped working.. I tried to calling to centre, but number is not reachable.. Later i raised a ticket in their warrty claiming website.. Ticket got generated but no one has turned back to me.. Only the on package and specifications it is mentioned as one year warranty in reality no warranty.. If something goes wrong then it is yur mistake.. Im unable to understand wat has to be done to replace the product.. Amazon is also not taking it back.. Please if someone know solution for this please let me know..Product is pretty cool but Very very bad service.\\n', \"\\n  Good balanced sound for daily use. Soft eartips and the included buds of different sizes are comfortable. The lime green colour is easy to recognise in a black bag, and is not gaudy or too flashy. The only slight negative is that the white eartips show even the slightest of earwax. So, you'll want to keep cleaning them.\\n\", '\\n  Bass quality: is a bummer, though the name of this earphone is basshead 242, i feel base to be inferior and very inadequate to my taste as well as in contrast to the treble/ highs base feels rather weak.Sound profile: Clear sound. Dynamic range is \"Fine\" .Though the lack of bass makes it feel hollow. Don\\'t go by the reviews calling it a great bass-y earphone, it\\'s not.Good build quality- as per first impressions. Though I\\'m skeptical about how long it\\'ll last.Noice Cancellation: No active cancelling(off course) but seals pretty well in ear canal so is quite adequat for isolation in a noicy bus joirney. Earphone is pretty loud.The higher end in the sound profile is overpowered. Sharp sounds are more prominent in comparison to base/lows.\\n', \"\\n  I personally use Sony XB series but, bought it for my mom who listens to Radio on her basic Nokia. Tried it on my smartphones (with PowerAmp, manual Eq). I am pretty sure Sony can't offer this performance at this price.Given the price, this is the last bargain guys.WOW! Not comparing Sony here. It was just an adjective!It didn't come no near to my Sony XB. But it's worth the money, on discount, surely\\n\", \"\\n  First Impression : Feels kinda premium. It feels like it could get a bit further in to the ear. Not a firm fit. The green one has much damper color, not same as in the picture. Volume is way good. Overall not bad.After 1 month : REALLY BAD MIC. Longer use is uncomfortable due to the design, if you smile or do any facial expression, it does hurt and irritate. More treble than bass. Volume buttons are very helpful.Casual music listeners, joggers...etc etc go for it.If you are going to use this for calls, don't buy this.\\n\", \"\\n  Earphones sound good with some emphasis on bass but it's not overpowering. They're lightweight and cable quality is nice.If you crank up your Equalizer and boost the bass, the earphones literally start vibrating on high volumes. The best part is there's no distortion whatsoever, good earphones by boat 👌. They sound much better than my previous mi basic.Only con is on using the earphones for 2+ hours, ears start hurting a bit.It also comes with a clip so that you can wear these to your workouts.Offers a lot for ~500₹ range, can't go wrong with this purchase.Pros-LightweightCan handle strong bassSort of braided cableWing tipsGood sound qualityValue for money ✔️Cons-Maybe cut down on the packaging, lot of paper and plastic wasted\\n\", '\\n  Dont read the reviews, i dont know how, but they dont justify the product for sure, i though every boat earphones are amazing but thats not the case here fr sure. It might be possible i got a defective piece but whatever i received was horrible, the earphones were blurry and doesnt have base at all.\\n', \"\\n  Bass is very high. It doesn't sound good. BoAT should improve the bass quality.Also, wire seems less durable.However at this price no other good options are available.\\n\", '\\n  This is one of the best earphone purchases made by me. It has an amazing sound and bass quality, fits well into my ear and has good noise cancellation. I always find trouble finding good earphones because most of them do not fit into my ear and falls off. This one has a good design and fits well into the ear, the build quality is very good. The mic works very well too. My voice was heard clearly on the other side during calls. It works well on both mobile and laptop. The price is also extremely reasonable for this quality. I would 100% recommend to buy this headset.\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality  is not good , uncomfortable  , sound is very loud , it be uses for calling not for music,  at this price 500 we can say ok , but  I can't  reccomend  this to by who want to use for long time it can damage ear\\n\", '\\n  Very bad product . Sound clarity is too bad. Just some bass only. Never buy from amazon. If you happen to have a return then they wouldn’t refund you back.\\n', '\\n  I have been using it now for 3 months..1.Quality- the Cable and byild is not as good as like bassheads 220 they had flat strong premium cables with metal buds housing but this one is okay too..but also very light and comfortable strong fit...you can use for long periods and the sports hooks can be helpful while gym and tunning2.sound_ quality if the sound is so crisp clear and amazing... instruments separation is awesome and vocals mids lows are amazing3. Bass- Bass in this is veey clear and high quality punchy bass but not for bassheads it have good amazing bass but not like heavy super bass of bassheads 220...u will love this bass more than others because it is very punchy hard and deep but not extra\\n', \"\\n  ProsSound quality is one of the best in the price range.The bass is not that high, so its good if you prefer vocals more.It has full 3 button control instead of the one button which makes it easier for music controlConsThe wire is WEAK. It broke in a few monthsIt has no flat  or braided cable instead a thin plastic one.( it gets tangled always)The earbuds are of bad quality. The buds hole is wider which makes sound better but the quality of the bud is not good infact its worse than any boat earphone.It doesn't have L shaped or angled jack which i don't prefer.\\n\", \"\\n  Just got it. Listened some old Kishore Kumar songs. Not impressed. Probably the right thing what ₹399 can get. MRP is ₹1,490 which is surely a marketing tact. Comes with a pair of extra buds and a carrying pouch and a clip. It's too early to comment on it's IPX4 water resistance. For sub ₹500 it's okay.1st edit: it tangles.\\n\", \"\\n  Its audio quality is highly addictive  especially when i listen Skechers . Just go for it . If you are having a confusion of ear hooks ,then it might can trouble you for 1 day only after that you will use to it . I don't know why Realme buds 2 have hype so much , even it doesn't have such sound quality it is broken under 1 tear and company refuse to replace it .\\n\", '\\n  I suggest you dont buy this if u r a bass and music lover...i had lot of expectation from this product but it cant even reach 30-40% of expectation...dont waste time and money here...for me boat nirvana bliss is best..go for it..\\n', '\\n  i will make it short, I bought it cause it was cheap and Build quality looked nice, so far i have no issue, been quite happy with its clarity & Bass, Each people have different taste in music & Design so some may hate it or love it But this this product sure is good for its price. I have no complaints.\\n', \"\\n  I am writing this review after using 3 month of this earphone.This earphone has good bass, sound, quality as well as noise cancellation is also good. You are not going to complain about these parameters after buying it.This earphone has sufficient length of wire which will make more comfortable while traveling or jogging.The earphone's earclip is soft and comfortable design in compared to other earphone.At first earclip generates little pain in ears but after using 1-2 week  I am comfortable with it.I got it in 499 rupees. The price of this earphone vary between 450 to 550 during sales.It is better against boat 225 in sound quality, bass.But in compared boat 225 it is not good plated and it not fully matleic (partially Matleic).As well as boat costumer care service is also good.Updated reviewIf the metallic part of earphone (3.5 mm pin cap & earphone joint part) got scratch the whole metallic part will loose the colour like a layer of paint (or like stiker).\\n\", '\\n  In this price range these earphones are simply awesome. I got boat bassheads 100, bassheads 225 and bassheads 242 and no need to mention bassheads 242 are farr better than these all with a really heavvvy bass and more balanced audio. The comfort of the earphones is incredible and you wont even feel like you  are wearing these on. Ear hooks too come handy with outdoor activities. No need to see any further reviewJUST GO FOR IT.\\n', \"\\n  Value for money - got myself 2 this time. I love the ear hooks; infact, I have been buying Boat ear phones for quite sometime now - never been disappointed. The ear hooks are a winner; you can't manage a ear phone without the hooks - they are a must to tame the ear phone.\\n\", \"\\n  1. Product quality- better quality2. Bass - Best bass in this price3.

NIETHER THE BASS IS GOOD NOR THE CLEARITY EVEN IF U PUT FULL VOLUME IT'S DOESN'T SOUND LIKE I ARE IN FULL VOLUME.OVER ALL I FEEL CHEATED WITH DESCRIPTION,I HAD USED BOAY BASS EAR FONES EARLIER IT WAS GOOD BUT THIS IS REALLY BAD REALLY BAD.\\n\", \"\\n  I'm writing this review after 6 months of usage.Initially I was ok but slowly i started facing problems.1) The wire entangles a lot. Since the wire is not slippery material it becomes difficult to straighten it up.2) The silicon holders come out easily. but its somehow locked in the earpiece so it wont fall off and lost so its a smaller problem3) The silicone caps come out easily. I lot it couple of times, luckily find it out and now being extra careful. Few times it was left in my ear itself. Funny.4) the buttons on the mouth piece are pretty hard and clunky.Although its not all hopeless stuffSound quality is satisfactory, Bass is good\\n\", '\\n  I bought my headphone and I am not using my remote much but after a week just on 6 September night I soon realized that the remote had a fault in it and oops I ran out of my return date a day before if you really want my suggestion then take boat 225 or 252 somewhat like that because I have used both and yes that is better than this productWorst product.........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!..........\\n', \"\\n  1. Bass isn't as good as the BoAt BassHeads 225, and i personally prefer the 225 sound quality better. This seems like a filtered down audio quality, like it might be very so slightly watered down, compared to the rich audio experience of the 225. The difference is minute though.2. The ear hook really makes sure the earphone doesn't slip out due to long duration of usage, is sweat-proof, and is good for a high movement workout (if you can manage the cable)3. Gets tangled pretty easily4. The ear hooks can tend to prick sometimes over long periods of wearing them\\n\", '\\n  I switched from Skullcandy to boatMy first purchase from boatFully satisfied with the product qualityGood cable lengthCable is Fully hardened10mm drivers done their jobIn line mic is good and volume Rocker is very handy to control volumeComes with 2 extra pairs of buds and 1 earhooksVery light weightAfter using sometime u forget that there is something in earsThough plastic housing for drivers they are of good qualityIf u are choosing between 225 and 242 go for 242225 comes out of the box with metal buds and they are bit heavy in earsComing to sound quality 4/5 cuz previously I used SkullcandySome drops during playing lowsBass is goodWorth for money\\n', '\\n  Its a great deal for 499 Rs., as always boat gives you good products. Mostly incomparable price and quality is what they seek. The 242 series is like a bundle of joy within a economic range. The sound is good the balance between bass and treble along with mids and highs are great. Instead of saying noice cancellation I would like to call it a nice noise isolating earphone. \"Plug in to feel the beats...\"\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality is really good ..!! Can't say anything about build quality as of now looks good but needs more look into it but 449 it's worth ..!! If your boatbass225 then you don't need this one !!\\n\", '\\n  The boat lovers might get offended but to be honest i never got a decent earphone from boat under Rs.2000.And this one is same too , the bass boost is off balance . sound is not pleasant , the earpiece is large and feels uncomfortale , so you cant wear it more than two hours . But in the price range I think it is a applicable product .But if your interested to spend a little more then I would recommend using sony earphones , it will cost to you a little bit more than the boat earphones but it is worth it .\\n', '\\n  1= Sound Quality is best in this Headphone, But some time bass was starting struggle, But if your phone have a Equaliser then adjust the bass in Your Style.2= The Built quality,  Built quality was really superb i mean in the case of built quality, This is a killer headphone.3= A wire quality was also superb, Dobble couted Wire with rubber protection.4= i am test this headphone in rain its really work good in rain.\\n', '\\n  Bass Is awesome Feels Like Dual Driver.Damn I can Feel My Ears vibrate. not Painful At All . listen to Songs U Like 🤣499 Puta Paisa Wasol The Case Could Have Been Better . but The Bass Is Better .Will Be Duing A Durability Test . rough Use Should Last Like 6 Months Sweet Base. i Only Listen To Trance And This Is Just Awesome Noise cancellation Is Awesomewaterproof Tested Working fine Does Not Come Of while Running And also at 130 KmPh On My Bike Its Still There . cable Is Strong Can Easy Manage To Pick Up ur Phone Without Breaking The Wire.Class Item Hai Bhai.\\n', \"\\n  It is used for 8 months one side does not working now I applied for the warranty and take the product but now the boat has not replied to my email and calls @boat I very disappointed by the boat company.Very very worst response from the boat they replaced my headphones after 2 months and they send green colour but my headphones colour is black and they send without any box and rubbers (ear buds) very very bad response don't buy any boat accessories the warranty they told is fake.\\n\", '\\n  The boat bass head earphone is just awesome one that I have used till.The ergonomic design just made to get awful feel to the user.The quality of wire is outstanding than the other branded ones which is on same price slot.It also provided two extra buds to fit those who needs it.They have got covered the wire with a rubber kinda material..for avoiding it from cracking.Overall the earphone nailed it in the 549 rps style.\\n', '\\n  I like everything about this but the only one and the worst problem is that while talking on the call, I received my voice back and can’t hear talk at all.

The Earphone has stopped working. I am so pissed at BOAT for selling this garbage.\\n', \"\\n  The earphones were very uncomfortable the first time I tried them on but I thought I might get used to it. Turns out comfort was not the only issue with them. I know boAt is known for it's bass but what I didn't know is that it'd be at the expense of a good overall hearing experience. The bass is so high that it actually ends up muffling the dialogues and other sounds. I can see their use in rock music but in a normal movie ? Nope, not the right choice. Also, did I mention that they are not at all comfortable even after a few days of usage ? Anyways, I am going to return them. Hope I get a refund and not a replacement.P.S. - The Samsung original earphones were the BEST.\\n\", '\\n  Earphone stop working with in 3 months and they have worst customer support center in the world. When i complaint and request for a replacement they shipped me empty box. Now they are not responding my call. felling angry and thugged\\n', \"\\n  One of the best products ever introduced by boat.This review is based on 6 months use of this product.Al though it is the first time I have used this model from boat, but I have to admit that I bought it after lots of references from different sources and I wasn't disappointed.It's build quality is flawless; applaud the use of double coated wire with the braided mesh.Sound quality is the best in this price range catagory.Treble and bass is balanced, still you can hear a minor vibration at high volume but it's not that distinguished. It is the side effect of all the long hours I have put in this.\\n\", '\\n  I like the product initially with the sound quality and the fit but with in a year I was end up in mike issue and some trouble with the one side of speaker. I just try to claim the replacement and mailed to the boat support team. They got the damaged headset from me and they have tracking mechanisms for checking the status of the ticket, issue for their side is they won’t update the status properly to customer and due to covid situation I don’t think they have working technical support team to resolve my ticket. I am really frustrated in following up with them. It’s be more than 3 months and I haven’t got any proper updates. Not even replying via email\\n', '\\n  The first prodyct given was too loud and the have anmoying bass like 50 rs headfones....this was replaced and these one are ok. May rate 3 for thisnproduct...good for young crowd whonlike to listn loud music....not good for peole who have heavey use for calls and meetings..\\n', \"\\n  I am using this earpiece for last 10 days and I found this one really good. Here are my observations till now. Will update you more after using for a longer period.- Sound quality is really good- Build quality is above average.- Bass is really good, didn't expected that good. Not so high not so low.- Noise cancellation works fine.- Cable length and layout is also good.- Ear clip works fine and it make this earphone sporty. Though I felt a bit pain in my ears after using it for longer period.Overall this earphone from Boat is a masterpiece in this price range in my opinion. I would definitely recommend to buy.\\n\", \"\\n  I'm still using this earphones continuously from last 5-6 months.I have to say its perfectly made finished product in this price range.Sound quality its super crystal clear sound better than its previous basshead model and also mic quality is too good.Bass is perfectly balanced you can say between medium & high level of bass just like previous model.It's build quality is amazing rough & tough.It's wires are tangle free with plastic coating so it too strong 💪.And its also water resistant that is the plus point.And at last its too stylish in look it's complete package in this price range just go for it.\\n\", '\\n  Not worth more than 200rs. Packet was damaged and opened by someone before me. Earphone had scratches as if it is refurbished and not new.Edit: REPLACEMENT UNIT WAS UPTO THE MARK. QUITE NICE BUT CERTAINLY NOT FOR MUSIC LOVERS....GOOD FOR GYM.\\n', \"\\n  So I just received earphone two days before. I am writing this review after using it for 2 days.Sound all over great.Bass I would say not that good but its pretty nice at this price. So you can actually hear music great no problem at all. I would say the build is actually good at this price.The earphone is also good and it doesn't cause pain in ears while using. I used for continuous 3 to 4 hours no pain at all.Overall Good soundNot great but nice bass.But at this price range it is good\\n\", '\\n  Well the built quality is okay but I do not understand why there are so many positive reviews regarding these earphones since there are many others better and cheaper than these however I was fooled by reviews otherwise I would have gone with my Mi basics that are cheaper and much superior to these in terms of sound quality, so do not buy them if you are conscious about sound quality otherwise the built quality is okay of these headphones and I would update my comment after using these for sometime on durability and all\\n', \"\\n  Punching Bass. Looks good. Wire doesn't look sturdy so would need to be careful.\\n\", '\\n  I got boat earphone thinking the qaulity of these will be marginally more tusting or superior, but i have again been let down.The earphone were working perfectly for only 2-4 days after delivery- this made me think all is well. So I thew away my packaging. Rookie Mistake. DO NOT THROW THE PACKAGING.After the first 4 days the mic completely died. Making me thin something is wrong with my phone or laptop, but not the earphones(AS THEY WERE JUST 4 DAYS OLD!)Anywho now they are lying around in  the house. The only value it adds is maybe the pop of color it brings to my messy drawer in which they lie buried.\\n', \"\\n  These are too good if you ask me for the price range. Didn't expect an earphone to be so good at this price range. It sits up pretty well in your ears and you wont have to keep the volume 100 at any point of time. It is so good that in indoors even 60-70% volume does it. Probably when you go out and there is a lot of noise will you have to keep the volume at 80-90%. Go for it eyes closed.\\n\", \"\\n  when i got rhe product i was kinda happy but later i realized how cheap it is.. it literally gives me headaches the high notes are way too loud... you cant just relax putting this. Please don't keep high expectations from this product. It broke my heart. My worse decision in purchasing ever.\\n\", '\\n  Literally the best earphones in the price range. The 10mm drivers thump a good bass, but not the best. Very comfortable and stays in ears with the hooks on. Better than the boAt bassheads 225 of the same price range. The boAt bassheads 225 are very bad for using while sleeping. But these are better compared to those and these also have in-line volume controls and are absent in the bassheads 225. I highly recommend these instead of boAt bassheads 225.\\n', \"\\n  Awesome for bass lovers best bass I've ever got... Fits comfortably snugs in with the flexible in ear hook. Good lengthy wire very useful for tall users...and sportsmen...Doesn't flash awkward looks simple and neat with great performance... And expected perfect mic placement...thumbs up from me....\\n\", \"\\n  The earphones have good sound quality, fit comfortably inside your ears, and stay there even if there's sweating, and never caused any irritation even after 3-4 hours of continuous use. So far so good. But after about 6 months my worst fears came true and sound stopped coming out of the right earpiece. Do yourself a favour, and buy something else.\\n\", '\\n  The best product for this price. You may get it for around 400-500. Definitely not worth the mrp cost 1500.Very decent fit and ergonomics.It has volume rockers and play/pause buttons which works on iphone android and also on win pc.A decent sound quality for thr cost.Bass lovers would hate it.Music lovers may not be impressed.But part-time listeners and best suited for callings and meetings.\\n', '\\n  Amazing Fit which I will rate as 9 out of 10 and Amazing Sound Quality of 9.9 out of 10 because there is always a scope for improvement in the sound quality. The bass is just fine and not overused which is a very good point but it might be deal breaker for some. The Button Functions are not so cool as they appear but they work just as fine, Mic is perfect and the extra earbuds provides a wide ranging satisfying experience as per your use and fit.Overall a decent and stylish product with  addons of a fine quality carry  pouch and a clip of satisfying material. You will love this product.\\n', '\\n  It gives excellent sound reproduction, cancelling all outside noises. But it does not fit well into the ear. It needs to hook on to the outer ear to fit well. As of now, it keeps falling out constantly. The present hook design is not good.\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality is good. But only the sound quality doesn't matter. The ear hooks got loose in just a week and it even comes out if you keep your headphones in your pocket. The clip when mounted, bends the wire. The 3.5mm plug is not L-shaped and at times its very hard to unplug it from the device as the grip is small.Sound quality is good but think about the above before you buy.\\n\", \"\\n  Don't buy this product.this is the worst quality.sound quality is good but it won't last long.the wire was very thin.i received the damaged product after using this couple of days one side of earphone is not working..😒 this is the 3rd time same happens with the boat company.i decided to quit from buying this company products..very unsatisfied..👎\\n\", \"\\n  It's ok ok type not a great sound quality, I was using monster earphone that cost me around INR 1500 where sound quality was awesome, look wise it's classy and seem sturdy but sound is quiet loud and not soft as expected. I like soft sounds like Bose, JBL. Ok if budget is INR 500.\\n\", \"\\n  Received original product. Audio quality is nice but it doesn't have much noise cancellation. Within 6 months the mike and the jack part of the earphone stopped working but it was under warranty so I sent it back for repair and they took 1 month for it so I have to buy another pair  .

It is worth for the price I paid. Previously I was using mi headset in this price range, since i am using it for a year , I changed to this product, I dont feel much bass and sound quality, i think it is because i am using MOTO.I should try in some other mobiles in order to check the sound quality.Previously I was dissatisfied with amazon for providing wrong product, But now they delivered it on correct time and correct product.I would like to suggest amazon to make their app more user friendly like flipkartThanks.\\n', '\\n  this product is received by me on 14th Feb 2020 ... after using for 3 to 4 days I was facing issue while talking,the issue was regarding mic .. another end was not able to hear my voice.other than that wired thickness is very thin so for rough users avoid purchasing this ..Advantage:sound quality and bud comforts are much better and comfortablebass is also good\\n', '\\n  Sound qualiy is good bass is extremely good and this is totally worth buying this earphone at his nominal price.Thanks team boat.\\n', \"\\n  As been said by my friend he liked this headphone very much but it's noice cancelation in not bad but I will give 4 stars because earphones don't have better noice cancelation then headphones.I will personally will suggest you to buy headphones.\\n\", \"\\n  I've been majorly a fan of boat earphones.

After the use of 4 months it stopped working. Being a 1 year warranty I applied for replacement to the boat. BOAT refused to replace and state that \"Your Invoice is Invalid\" This is very ridiculous that Invoice generated by AMAZON declared Invalid.  Friends Please don\\'t buy product from BOAT .\\n', \"\\n  Don't get fooled by the reviews. The build quality is worse, the earphones are glued. The base is boosted a lot by default, which is completely distorted ( not balanced). The bass suppresses the treble and the earphone kinda vibrates which is very annoying.

There was very minimal bass and sound clarity was like the earphones u get inside a flight.

But I would pick the Boat 100 anytime if you want a good budget earphone.\\n', '\\n  I am coming from boat 225 and trust me this is really an upgrade to it every problem in 225 has been fixed....its angled fitting is the best....max volume is very loud......bass is too good just one thing this is bang for a buck just get it over any other earhone blindly and u will not regret honestly\\n', \"\\n  Great earphone at this price range.Pros: Wire has some coating over it which is great. Bass is good. It has volume & next buttons. Earbud is small in size which fits verywell in ears and doesn't come out like my earlier basshead 225.Cons: You can NOT hear song at full volume since it has loud sound, but it can be avoided by hearing at less volume.Overall i liked it and worth to buy.\\n\", '\\n  Awesome headphones under 500rs.Best audio quality, good noice cancellation, and clear voice via microphone when on call.Ps.

The hooks fit well and option to change track is also there but the sound quality is not up to the mark.

In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4.

Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.\\n', '\\n  Defective product received, it gets 8 to 12 hours in charging and Amazon is not exchanging the product\\n', \"\\n  Very poor performance.

Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..\\n', '\\n  Heating problem.

So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21.\\n', \"\\n  Worst phone of my life I have ever purchase . Due to this pandemic situation and blaming china for this corona virus I have decided to purchase a korian company phone . But I broke up my trust . Battery life is poor as it's shows 6000Mah but performance wise it's behave like 4000Mah. Bcuz it's drain so quickly processor is very slow it's hang up in 5 minute and heat like u can make your veggie on this even it's can burn ur ears finger print is not responding I have washed my hand many time but it's not ready to recognize it's. Finally my humble request to amazon pls return this I have made a big mistake to purchase it. Pls help me to return it\\n\", \"\\n  A nice looking phone.Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.\\n\", \"\\n  Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.\\n\", \"\\n  Don't like this product. It looks, it's already used by someone else. Apps are not downloading. It shows 6 appsare downloading. I'm confused.\\n\", \"\\n  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀\\n\", \"\\n  Amazon delivered a defective phone to me and then they don't even receive my call while I tried to approach them.  Buying Samsung Galaxy M21 is waste of money.\\n\", '\\n  I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k\\n', '\\n  1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.It’s better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.\\n', \"\\n  I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours.\\n\", '\\n  Samsung m21 Mobile not in the delivery box, only charger and pin are available. Need refund for the same.For mobiles, its better to opt for cash on delivery, to avoid getting cheated.\\n', '\\n  Display good, battery  performance  after one  week  of use has improved,camera is good,hope Samsung  provides  regular  updates..Excellent  phone  keep good  work  up Samsung 👌\\n', '\\n  Realy very very good phone,but stil I did not get,due to covid\\n', \"\\n  There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.\\n\", '\\n  Battery  drain quickly... and phone heat a lot.\\n', '\\n  I got phone having mic issue and there is no option to put a replacement request as i tried download the blanco app that doesnt work and just hanged in between and no technical person available to check whenever i called..so how would i place the request to replacement??\\n', \"\\n  What can I say just after 30 min.of recieving this phone I applied for return my money.

For the price you getting a quality phone with massive battery life.Here are the pros:-Good qualityExcellent displayExcellent batteryBest cameraHere are the cons:-Speaker quality is not good. It's loud but distorted at high volume with no bass at allHeadphone quality is ok. Not the best. I prefer wireless because of Dolby AtmosCharging speed is ok, not fast nor slow. It took 2hrs to fully charge. It's fast for 6000mahCamera app need a redesignAside all this.. it is the best phone under 15k.Go for it.\\n\", '\\n  I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc\\n', '\\n  Good product\\n', \"\\n  The phone is simply amazing. The Raven Black model looks gorgeous. Very sturdy. The camera quality is excellent. The UI is user friendly. This phone is similar to the Samsung range of phones, so it is hard to decide the model that's best for its price. According to my analysis, M21 is a good by at 12699/-.\\n\", '\\n  At this cost, the phone looks premium. For folks who like a premium looking phone not the fancy looking phone, this is the best at this price segment. all other products at this price bracket consist of fancy and decorated back which may not be the cup of tea for a section of people for whom simple and plain is the premium. Monster battery, One of the best display at this price segment, great finger print sensor, decent camera etc..

I am full satisfied with the purchase 😊\\n', \"\\n  So, here it is after using it for more than a month. this phone has a lot of impressive features but lacks a bit of punch when it comes to processing power.My usage is mostly for calling, whatsapp, and video viewing, i don't use much of social media apps and not into too much gaming as well. Still this phone manages to freeze even with just one app running it can be just the chrome browser. Here is summary of what i observed  - Samsung one ui comes with lot of annoying advertisement and notifications, i suspect these galaxy app hog cpu in the background  - Privacy is a huge concern specially with discover feature  - For those who are accustomed to having google news feed by swiping right on home screen, you will find it missing in this phone  - Phone freezes a lot, typical workaround for me is to lock it and wait for a minute unlock and it works  - Wide angle camera shots are really good  - camera quality is nice as well  - battery life is  great, i am charging every two days instead of daily night  - look and finish a not extra-ordinary but are not bad as well  - Does not allow you to restore from google backup on start which is a headache on setting it up, it does come with samsung switch app but that would just install app and cannot restore login and data like google restoreverdict=====Buy this if you are ok with advertisements (i guess same is true with mi, realme etc) from samsung, not too much into heavy usage like gaming etc.Edit 1====phone freeze issue reduced by a lot by removing external sd card. Browser does freeze sometimes but the frequency is a lot lessSamung ui misses user friendly sms/call blocking, you have to select individual message sender details and then block which is a headache and can be improved\\n\", '\\n  Just after starting the phone I am facing the heating problem .

I further thought to convince my friends & relatives to use Samsung gadgets instead of Xiaomi. But after purchasing Samsung Galaxy M21 from Amazon which was delivered on 30-05-2020, my whole enthusiasm went in trash and I am helpless to compare it with my last handset Redmi 8 which was valued just Rs. 7,999/- as compared to Rs. 12,699/- of Samsung Galaxy M21. I don’t want to compare Samsung with Xiaomi handsets, but now realize how Xiaomi has captured Indian market in short span of time, surely because of quality & performance of their gadgets.I am trying Amazon customer care since 01-06-2020, but unable to connect and no response from their side. Below are serious issues found in just 2-3 days of using Samsung Galaxy M21 :• While using wi-fi calling feature, outgoing calls & receiving of SMS gets completely barred• While using wi-fi, HD call gets stopped• Whole battery gets drain in just 6-7 hours, not upto 6000 mAh handset performance.• Fingerprint sensor is very weak, it takes 3-4 times for login• Dual apps feature is limited for few applications only• Voice recording feature needs improvementPlease support in getting this issue resolved at the earliest.\\n', '\\n  Everything about this phone is great...best phone and best brand 💪💪.Loved it and nowi am enjoying it 😍😍\\U0001f929\\U0001f929\\U0001f970\\U0001f970😇😇\\n', '\\n  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch \"hater\" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi\\'s. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!\\n', \"\\n  Believe me...the best smartphone you can buy at this price range if you are not a hardcore gammer...don't compare it with cheap Chinese products.\\n\", \"\\n  When the phone arrived 1st 2days are quite good and phone worked perfectly.  But after 2days it started showing sone battery problems and battery lasts only upto 3 to 4 hrs which not accepted with this phone and it's getting even worse now. And now Amazon is not responding to it . It seems like i lost my 13 thousand money.  If any help provided it means alot to me coz i didn't expected this kind of trust issue with amazon.\\n\", '\\n  Battery charging takes too much time and when opted for replace, so much of formalities by amazon. Highly disappointed of purchasing such a valuable item from Amazon. Only by technician check, and after his report, amazon decides whether the item should be replaced or not. No value for customer words. Very bad experience with amazon purchase.\\n', \"\\n  Samsung galaxy m21 (I'm having 4gb ram variant) is a excellent phone in this price segment.Pros:1. Best display under 20k2. Great audio quality via headphones jack (supports dolby audio which is obviously a gimmick but this phone has high res support hence if you have Poweramp you would get maximum quality performance from it.) and has a loud output from loud speaker.3. Excellent battery life (for heavy use easily getting SOT more than 8 hours)4. Great for watching movies supports for FHD+ playback in ott.5. Good performance, not stutters or lag I have noticed (I usually dont keep more than 3 apps in background when in not use).6. Games don't lag or have frame drops if I have moderate graphics. (Even pubg runs great in smooth and extreme settings).7. Samsung One UI is the best next to stock Android (Oxygen os, stock android no big difference except few additional features in Oxygen os). Also comes with Android 10 out of the box.8. Decent camera quality both front and back.9. Unlike previous m series phones this one comes with Corning Gorilla glass 3 and I haven't applied any screen protection and have no scratches till now🤞🤞🤞10. Multitasking is the best feature in this phone. Pop up view mode is a excellent festures. Helps to play games listening to music in youtube or other apps, text messages, browse web simultaneously with this large display.Cons :1. Plastic back can easily get scratched can be avoided using a case.2. Could have added 18W fast charging capabilities takes 2-2.5hours to fully charge (from 15 or 20% to 100).3. Not for gamers who expect high graphics. But recommend for casual gamers or gamers who would be okay to play in moderate graphics.4. Worst camera quality in night mode. Night mode photos are totally unusable. (Samsung may fix this issue with software update if they work on this issue)Conclusion:Don't know why many are complaining about poor battery life or heating issue or games totally unplayable complaints. Dont spread false informations.I haven't faced these issue, even in heavy useage.Buy this phone if you want a all-rounder phone which ticks every boxes.Fyi,Like all other phones in this price segment, even Samsung pushes ads, but here during initial setup of the phone it ask if we would opt for recommendations. If we opt out we wont get any ads and recommendations.👍👍👍\\n\", \"\\n  This is my second review.  This is after a week's use. So far I have found that phone is good. In my first review I had tod that battery is not that good. But now I feel that I was wrong. A day almost 10 to 20 percentage battery drain.

The seller just delivered a used product with loads of defects. The camera was not functioning, the torch was not functioning and there could be more defects. I was just checking the item the moment it was delivered and encountered with these two defects. Upon unboxing, I found that the phone had a tempered glass already fitted to it. Initially I overlooked this but later realized that someone who had purchased it invested on the glass (and may have used it for a couple of days) with the defects before finally rejecting it. I think the M21 product should be fine and it is upon the seller who tried to strike a deal in such troubled times.

Which I need to highlight is this phone have serious network issue I have also shown this issue to my nearest Samsung Service Centre they even can't help me so if you guys have a very  bad network or average Network at your home or your workplace so this phone is not for you..\\n\", '\\n  galaxy m21 review:-first of all, it\\'s a very similar device to the galaxy m30s galaxy a50s and galaxy a51 in terms of internal you can\\'t tell the difference between galaxy m30s and m21 in just looking at it. there are some differences between the two devices but not a lot.good:-Display:- so this is the main feature of this phone a full HD super AMOLED display on a 14000 rupees phone is very rear and this the differentiating feature of this device, which include lots of feature of own it\\'s own such as always on true notch hiding and some battery-saving features so it doesn\\'t have the on-screen fingerprint sensor which frankly speaking a good thing because Samsung\\'s in-screen fingerprint sensor is bad really bad it\\'s that bad you  prefer not to use it, and it\\'s fingerprint also have swipe gestures for the notifications which work all the time unlike it\\'s the in-display fingerprint sensor.Software:- software is also really good and it has some neat feature too like the system-wide dark mode which saves battery on the AMOLED screen\\'s and clean and well thought out layout for the one-handed use a good if not great out of the box launcher with few customizations, unlike some Chinese OEM\\'s software, hex installer, and the good lock is absent which is a big bummer for the customization freaks and overall it\\'s nicer UI than most of the Chinese ones and one thing more it also supports android 10\\'s stock navigation gestures which are a heck of a lot better than MIUI\\'s.battery:- it\\'s a full day battery comfortably with all the necessary sensors on the auto-brightness and vibration both of which disabled out of the box for some reason \"because Samsung thinks we are a fool\" it\\'s a 6000 MAH battery if this type capacity would provide another phone my be it was juice it out little longer than this phone does.camera :- this is very strange camera in default camera app shoots very saturated photo and the video is good honestly quite good for the price in day light in nights this phone just falls apart very easily, and wide angle camera is fixed focus which is a good thing or bad thing I don\\'t know, I use it very occasionally and I I am surprised to see that AR doodle and AR emoji is present In it\\'s camera app which is nice bonus.Bad or desired thingBuilt quality:- it\\'s a have a plastic back with a plastic frame means it\\'s a plastic phone and have plastic\\'s quirks like despite having a 6000 mAh battery, it feels light, relatively thin and more ergonomic, it\\'s a plastic, plastic materials are more prone to be scratched but it more durable than glass, if tap on the back around the camera it creates hollow sound so built quality is not on par with the competition.performance: - performance leaves a bit desired because it handles everyday stuff like WhatsApp Instagram and other productivity Apps quite smoothly and in games, it\\'s fall flat in front of the competition and in the 4gb variant 2GB of memory is occupied by the system already so ram Management is an issue in this device, and the stupid battery optimization is killing all the third-party apps in the background some of the like the music app suddenly stops playing song after 1 hrs, you have to disable the battery optimization from the setting in each app you use in the background all the time.Bloat & Ads:- it has all the Microsoft suits preloaded and be careful when you set up the device at the start don\\'t select the option ad recommendation option. even after that my galaxy apps constantly send the spammy notification.so it worth 14000? In my use case yes! I am not a heavy user I don\\'t play heavy games on my phone, for the heavy users, there are lots of better offerings on the online market!\\n', '\\n  Camera quality not that much what we expect rear and selfy both camera -pic quality missed , battery life max 18hours if we used data , This report as of after 3days usage\\n', \"\\n  No doubt i am loving Samsung m 21 4/64, which i ordered on 25th may, got delivered on 27th may. One thing to consider, this smartphone excels in display, camera quality and battery life...Processor is not that  powerful or not even close to sd 675 in terms of gaming. I have to use gfx tool, lowering resolution( less than hd) and other graphics stuff to Low with fps set to ultra(40fps). By applying this gfx tools settings i can play Pubg hell lot better with stable 30-40 fps. Dont try extreme,fps will be very unstable. With stock Pubg settings i am facing tremendous lags, stutters and fps drops even in the lobby, Cant say about 6/128 gb model. Didn't try Cod, i usually dont play, Pubg lite plays fine with smooth extreme option only. My verdict if u are not too much into gaming, Play clash of clans, or can adjust to above settings of Pubg, Go ahead to buy,  If pubg is top priority go with Vivo U20/Realme 6/Redmi note 9.\\n\", '\\n  Review for 6GB/128GB varient (Review after one month use)Pros: Really a amazing phone in peformance wise. smooth like iphone. Battery last for three days even with wifi and bluetoooth connected for almost 10 hours a day. High end games are running without lag. Dual speakers so music plays loud. No heating issue as of now. Depth camera is really cute, you must experience it to believe. Corrila glass doing its part perfectly. No scraches even after rough one month usage. Screen resolution in amazing; Super Amoled is really superb. Finger print senson is fast (even less than a second)Cons: Apart from depth camera all other cameras are not upto the mark. But its ok for unprofessional use. Not recommended for selife freakouts. Phone is little heavey due to 6000 MAH.\\n', '\\n  For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.Samsung Galaxy M21: Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display.A few months back, Samsung successfully made big-battery smartphones accessible with its M-series. But the mid-range is a tough segment to crack with the competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Realme. But Samsung knows how critical this segment is right now, given the current situation where consumers are more price-sensitive than ever. For these uncertain times, the new Galaxy M21 makes a lot of sense. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use the Galaxy M21 over the past week.Samsung Galaxy M21 specifications: 6.4-inch FHD+ SAMOLED display|Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM or 64GB/128GB storage|48MP main camera+5MP depth and 8MP ultra wide angle|6000mAh batery|20MP front camera|188grams, 8.9mm thick|Android 10, OneUI 2.0Samsung doesn’t try to be different with the Galaxy M21, and that’s just fine. Let me be clear: I don’t have too many things to say about the Galaxy M21 because the phone looks exactly like the Galaxy M31. So, the Galaxy M21 has a polycarbonate back like the Galaxy M31. Some people may not find it interesting but it never felt like using a cheap plastic phone.For a phone with a 6000mAh battery, the design and build seem perfect. I also liked the fact that the phone doesn’t feel heavy or bulky, considering the massive battery inside the device. However, I do feel the Galaxy M-series phones have become a bit too dull in terms of design. To be frank, none of this matters to a user who is coming from the Galaxy J-series or any older generation Samsung phone.Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display. The 6,000mAh battery in the Galaxy M21 goes on and on. It managed to last one and a half days with my standard usage pattern, which includes browsing the web, listening to Spotify, emails, checking Facebook and Twitter, and light gaming. Since the phone’s battery lasts for so long, you don’t want to worry about taking the charger with you. A quick-charge with the charger fills the phone’s battery in minutes.Another aspect of the M21 that I liked the most is the display. This is a big phone with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display. And since the phone uses an AMOLED display, the contrast level is great and the black levels are absolute. Even though a lot of mid-range phones these days offer AMOLED displays, the ones made by Samsung have better displays somehow. I found the screen absolutely fine for reading eBooks, watching YouTube, and web browsing. By the way, the small U-shaped notch doesn’t annoy me anymore. It did annoy me a lot at the beginning but it soon becomes a part of the scenery.Speaking of performance, the Galaxy M21 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M31. Samsung has used this processor on many of its mid-range phones and going by my testing, the chipset gets the job done. I was able to open all of the popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok on the device without any issues. But don’t try to run too many heavy games that could slow down the performance. The phone runs on Android 10, and Samsung has done a good job with OneUI 2.0. My review unit had 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage.You won’t get a great camera system, and that’s one area where I think the phone falls flat. You get a 48MP primary camera sensor alongside an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP depth camera. The 48MP main sensor is a hit and miss. Sometimes the photos look great and other times the photos come out of focus. That’s not to say the camera is bad, it is just not consistent. The Galaxy M21 takes bright shots but in some cases, images lack richness. Even though the phone lets you take ultra-wide angle shots or bokeh shots I wasn’t too impressed. In comparison to the Galaxy M31, the Galaxy M21 pales in the camera department. For a change, though, the Galaxy M21’s 20MP front-camera surprisingly worked well both indoors and outdoors.The Galaxy M21 performs similarly to the Galaxy M31. I mean, both phones have a 6000mAh battery, identical processors and displays, and even the design is the same. What the Galaxy M21 noticeably lacks, however, is a camera that’s not at par to the Galaxy M31. Still, there’s a lot to love about the Galaxy M21. For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.\\n', \"\\n  I order this mobile from amazon..first 1month experience is great..good quality camera,best battery,average fingerprint..but after 1 month the mobile give charging problem...mobile can't charge..when i call for help amazon says that go to samsung care ..no one can help when the product is damage...just harrssing us... don't buy from amazon..\\n\", '\\n  No wonder why Samsung is the most used & most loved smartphone brand in the world! This is my first Samsung phone and I exchanged my previous damaged phone online for 2k.After spending one whole month in researching the best phone under 15k, I finally got it figured out and chose Galaxy M21. And Youtube videos and comments helped me take the wise choice. I got the deal (4gb 64gb) at Rs.13,500 and got it delivered in 6 days.Plenty of reasons why I chose M21:Will to honour our country heroesMonster BatteryGreat Display (feels like you are also present in the movie)Trust in Samsung Brand NameBetter CameraLesser weight (a boon for long time gamers)Polycarbonate back (safe against drops)Premium look rather than Fancy Nancy cheap plastic bodyType C ChargerThe Processor Debate:To those who wonder the same as I did (If we can play Pubg smoothly),The honest answer is YES. Pls do not take third opinions who claim that Exynos processor is lame (which is a false claim of knowledge). I can\\'t say if it is bad or awesome, but it is definitely Decent! You can play Smooth+Extreme or Balanced+Ultra without any issue. Even if you do full and heavy usage for 12 hours continiously, battery is sufficient and fast charging works too. So i easily charge every night before going to sleep and turn it off in middle of night.Super Tips for Common Problems in All PhonesUpdate OS to avoid heating & restart issue (which happens not only in M21 but even in 60k phonesNever use a phone cleaner or battery saver app. Use the inbuilt power saving option.Turn off Bluetooth, Location, etc when not neededDon\\'t charge even after reaching 100%Close apps when not needed, especially close all when playing game (and also enable gaming mode)Uninstall least used appsWhoever reads this comment can trust me and click the Amazon \"Buy Now\" button without any fear because this is the ONE perfect-ish smartphone under 15k category.Friends.... this phone feels like you hold jewel in your hand .\\n', '\\n  \\xa0So of course battery and display is awesome.The charger is not soo fast but its okay, decent performance ,but i am very dissappointed with  its camera its not upto the mark (48megapixel) photo quality achhi nhi lgi, it doesnt capture the details  not even is this good for night or low light photography and in video its focus is worst\\n', '\\n  Super colour blue\\n', '\\n  \\xa0After reading a lot of reviews regarding network issues of the M31 and M21 I was a bit skeptical to buy the M21. I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception. After using the Honor 6x and Honor Play I was thinking of buying the Honor 9x pro but after I found out that it did not support Google Play I opted out. So then I began researching other brands and I came across the Galaxy M21. The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back. By chance I happened to come across a video in YouTube regarding LTE / 3g / 2g settings in the M21. Bingo! I knew where the problem was. So without waiting any longer I ordered this smartphone.After receiving it and using it for a few days I am glad my decision was correct. In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default. I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G. Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G. So if I select the LTE only option the phone will latch on to the 4G signal even if it becomes a little weak.So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone.

Heavy to hold and inconvenient to handle. Worst part is  Amazon doesn't have a return policy and suggested me to do a exchange instead with another brand of my choice (with heavy deduction of course).

But till now no reply or action has been initiated to redress my complaint.  Please do the needful at the earliest as my business is adversely affected due to faulty mobile phone.  After this request if no relief is provided to me I would have  only option of legal action in term of newly introduced consumer protection act.\\n', \"\\n  I have never been a fan of customized Android phones, and have mostly preferred phones with the stock Android. I was looking to a new phone because the manufacturer of my earlier phone did not support security updates that were required for my work apps / email.This is my second Samsung phone, after the 2010-launched Nexus S. Compared to earlier phones, this feels a little big and is heavier as well. Perhaps it could be due to the battery. So far, there is nothing to complain about, but I would have liked the price to be comparable to the Redmi models. I got this one for ~ Rs. 14K, which the seller claims is at a Rs. 2K discount. I wouldn't have bothered to pay Rs. 16K for sure. The Redmi Note 9 comes in at around Rs. 12K for similar configuration. I would have bought the Redmi phone, but the reviews made me feel suspicious about it (especially about the ads being displayed).Some stand out points:§ Made in India: I didn't have a constraint on this one, but hey, if it's made in India, then, why not.§ Selfie camera: Samsung says it us 20 MP. It is definitely better than other models I have been using. (Note: I almost always prefer phones below Rs. 15K)§ Android 10: This itself was my constraint. I was looking only for Android 10 phones. One of the most important things for me was the support for dark mode.§ Reputed manufacturer: Well, Samsung is the leader. So, can't go much wrong with this brand.§  Minor irritants:§§ The setup process feels as though using the Samsung's Smart Switch app is the only way to get data from your existing phone. If you do not want to use it, the setup wizard is slightly different than the stock Android version. If you have a backup of the previous Android phone on Google, that can be used as well. However, setup takes a long time as compared to the stock Android version.§§ The location of the back and recent app buttons on the navigation bar are swapped. I had to install a button remapper app to swap the 2 buttons.§§ Samsung tries to push its own apps and its account sign up. I avoided it like plague, and deleted all the unnecessary apps.§§ I prefer the Nova launcher app. I feel at home after installing this app.In short, after some customization, it was back to what I wanted.\\n\", '\\n  I was looking for a smartphone with good battery life for using it as hotspot, all other features were secondary for me. I am satisfied with the needs but I have to mention below thingsPros:Battery is good as per 5 days of usage with 30 + default google appsScreen is bright and very good to look atno lag for normal apps (im not a game fan) ConsWorst ever camera i used on a smartphone. 48MP is just the size of image, quality of what it captures is patchy and bad images. Camera quality compared to the advertisement is very bad.Heating issue when screen is on while charging.\\n', '\\n  First when I got this phone I found it has issues with mic. Hence I placed a request for replacing the item. Second time also I faced the same issue. When I am the caller, the receiver is able to hear my voice clearly. But when I am the receiver, caller is not able to hear me properly. I need to talk louder in order to be audible. I returned the phone again. I would want Samsung to check this issue and work on it. Otherwise all the other features in this phone are value for money.\\n', \"\\n  Perfect mobile phone with more storage space, Excellent sound quality with Dolby atmos ,extended battery life ..I tried to use full night to watch OTT web series.. morning 42% of battery life is pending.. if you keep volume less than 50% we can't hear any sound ..company should improve this .. we can't keep volume with 100% at all time...

M21 is a good phone at this price point. as its a big battery with 15W charging capacity it will take anywhere between 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge but once charged it can easily go for 2 days for non-gamer. Camera is good at this price point.The best thing is its Samsung, which has good after service and if you take samsung care + home pickup and drop. for M21 2 years the price of care+ is Rs1349 with everything covered except theft\\n', '\\n  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a month. The box comes with M21 handset, Power adapter, USB cable and ejection pin. Earphones are not included in it. The battery performance is quite good, it takes not more than 2 hrs to charge completely from zero to 100% and on medium usage, can last upto 2 days. The phone handset is very light weight as compared to M10, M20 which is very heavy to carry because of heavy weight of battery. One good thing is that the M21 handset as well charger or power adapter is made in India. As of now, the overall performance is good, battery output is efficient though there is some heating of device during charging, only sometimes & not always. Camera quality is good too but in natural light settings. I need to use this phone for some more time to further write detailed updated review but at the end of the day, Samsung can be trusted for their phones.\\n', '\\n  Biometrics is good i.e. fingerprint sensor and face recognition works very smooth. Phone performance is smooth , do not lag.But :-1. 6000mAh do not run for more than 24 hours in normal usage, no games, no music, song, just net crowsing over wifi.2. Camera is 48 MP but the sensors behind it make that 48mp pretty useless, the moment you zoom post taking 48mp photo (3:4) you will find out that it is not 48 mp, as pixel started splitting.3. Personally I did not like UI, so switched to Microsoft UI and that works smooth.\\n', '\\n  The seems ok. Plastic built phone. Camera is ok. Charger and cable seems poor in quality. the packaging was so poor. thank god that the product reached home safely. only a plastic cover as available. company not including any earphone, back cover or screen guard, nothingis present. its my first with with the phone.\\n', '\\n  Amazon deserves the innumerable accolades for delivering this phone in this maze of lockdown.  This is ineffable service from Amazon. This is great and uncomparable phone. THANK YOU SAMSUNG..outstanding performance and extraordinary battery life..\\n', \"\\n  The phone doesn't even turned on and It's not getting charged also. Unfortunately there is no return or refund policy for this. If you want to return this item you have to install one smartchek app and diagnose the issue, otherwise Amazon will arrange an inspection service at your delivery address and you'll get a replacement only if the technician is convinced. Amazon is simply cheating it's customers. Never expected this kind of discourteous service from Amazon.\\n\", '\\n  Batterry is verry verry very poor\\n', '\\n  Previous generations of Samsung phones used to provide better quality though. This one provides excellent specs for the price, but doesn\\'t come with earphones and its charging cable is very short. I have to use a USB extension cable to make up for that. Operation is real smooth and lots of space. Camera is okay, battery is great but that\\'s the \"standard\" in the age of Mi. Fingerprint reader frequently fails. Lots of features I enjoyed in the older Galaxy J7-6 are missing though. Thankfully almost all my customizations are preserved thanks to Smart Switch. Still for a Samsung phone it has too much bloatware. Thankfully I am able to disable all of them. Guess that\\'s why the low price, I\\'m content with it, with this RAM, storage and battery it\\'ll make overall usage comfortable.\\n', \"\\n  Review after 10 days..1.battery life is awesome.5/52.charging time is 2.30hrs from 0 to 100%.4.5/53.camera quality is nice. 4.5/54. processors is good for multi tasking but not for hard core gaming however causual games work fine 4.5/5.5.no network/call/data issues. 5/5display is awesome.5/5 no doubt.6.fingerprint sensor slowed down after 10 days 3/5.Overall al best budget phone but the delivery experience was horrible the delivery person was very rude to behave and even refused to come at the parking of the building...i could have rated 1 star but i don't want to spoilnthe reputation of the such big  company like SamsungYOU CAN ALSO SEE THE QUALITY OF INVOICE RECEIVED.....😡😡\\n\", \"\\n  The phone really is monstrous.This is my honest review after 20 days usage.PROS:Battery LifeSAMOLED DisplayCamera QualityOne UILooks for the price paid.Ease of UsageBudget FriendlyDolby Atmos SupportCONS:Pathetic 4G Network ReceptionShort WiFi ReceptionSlow Charging - 2.5hrs Full ChargeHope the network reception issues can be resolved via Software Update.In general I'm so happy with my purchace.Would suggest peeps to go for it.I'm Lov'n it already! 🙂\\n\", \"\\n  Overall seams good,I gave 2 star for battery life,Inspite of power charger it's take too long to get full charge.

It\\'s huge 6000mah battery survives 36 to 40 hrs in normal usage.2. Super AMOLED display having very nice colour contrast and all.3. Camera, it\\'s selfie camera having wide angle photo option & flash too and rear cameras also clicks very nice pictures, even in night both the cameras satisfies me and are very good in this price range.4. Latest Android 105. OneUI 2.0 support which having many enexpected features like you can use more than one apps simultaneously on single screen by minimising them, and we can generate a floating button for screenshot capture, screen off & many more functions, you can hide apps, and zipped apps for saving battery and many more.6. It\\'s Exynos 9611 processor gives a smooth performance, no lag noticed in 15 days usage.7. And one of the major factor is that it is a Non-Chinese mobile.Iske alawa bohot kuchh hai isme jo maine expect bhi nahi kiya tha.Cons:1. One thing I don\\'t like in it is it\\'s cheap Plastic body which is susceptible to scratches but you can manage with it by protecting it with a back cover.2. It takes approx. 3 hrs to fully charge.Bus PUBG nahi khela maine isme. So I can\\'t say anything about that.👍Otherwise, It completely satisfies me.😍😍😍\\n', '\\n  Display is the highlight. Best display on budget phone.Battery life is acceptable above 1 day of normal use. Charging takes much more time.Dont buy it for playing pubg. Battery heats up and after one hour very high frame drops and frequent restarting.Camera is way better than any other phones in the range. Skin tones and colour reproduction is somewhat natural.Overall good buy in the price range except for gaming.\\n', \"\\n  All of you guys know what are the plus points. Let me tell you the negative points-1. Camera is kind of ok ok, I have Realme 2 pro 16 mp sony sensor.. both are kind of same. But Samsung's hdr and dynamic range is superb.2. Battery not optimized. Maybe next update will fix this issue. Screen on time 8 to 9 hours. No gaming.3. Samsung running on February security patch. But my Realme 2 pro 1.5 year's old device running on latest security patch. Samsung's update policy is worst.4. Sometimes UI freezes just for 1 second. Not an issue of processor. UI needs more improvement.Hope it helps! Cheers!\\n\", \"\\n  Review after using 10 days..This Mobile has lot of issues..1. Network reception- This is really  lower than other mobiles..  There is low network  in my house but other mobiles work perfectly.. In this mobile, network i m getting is almost negligible..2. Battery Issue - company  claims  it to have 6000MH, but it drains too fast. I have compared with my 2 years old MI phone(4000mh). This phone drains little faster than mi. So what's the point of claiming  6000 mh3. Voice audio quality - quality  of the voice which you listen in your ear while talking to some is really bad like a cheaper phone's. Mostly  you need to be very attentive  to listen.4. Heating issue - And I have also read the reviews  that people are also having  heating  issues.

We are buying phone at  it's best  price but company fails to provide  its protection by avoiding temper  guard,backcover.  5. Low sound enhancement quality  6. Fails to provide premium back  design.By reviewing all features.I conclude it's better to buy other reliable cellphone under same price.If you are a samsung lover go for it.If not go through other device features and grab a better among one.Think twice before investing  some buks on cellphone. Grab better one .\\n\", \"\\n  It is the worst mobile I ever had. Company claims saying Gorrilla glass 5 protection is not justified as its screen broken with a single slip while sitting in the chair from my jeans pocket. Further no one is there to listen. We feel so bad that in India where there is world's largest market of mobile consumers, still there is no best mobile which can compete these Chinese cheap and best mobiles. I love my India. So will wait....\\n\", '\\n  The battery is not actually 6000mAh but slightly less which is around 5830mAh the battery comes around for 18 hours on intensive usage which is quite good for a phone on this budget. I love the texture of the phone. But it slips a lot when used without a case better go for a spigen case which is really good combination with the phone. The interface of the phone is quite simple and very easy to use . For people with smaller hands it is quite hard to reach the top with single hand . The camera is great but it goes hazy for night shots.Overall it is a great phone .\\n', '\\n  I had to wait for long for this mobile as I was told that this is getting sold out very soon. And indeed it stands upto its reputation. To sum up, solid built quality, excellent display,  fast processor make it stands apart from its Chinese competitors. Don\\'t Get fooled by its specs which say that it has polycarbonate body. Its rock solid chassis justifies its price. I\\'m not a gamer but I bought it for my mom.  So it\\'s perfectly alright. The battery life reminds me of old \"Hero Honda \" ad of \" just fill it and forget it\" . The speaker is not that too loud but quality of music through headphones is very good especially when you switch on Dolby atmos. I used sennheiser px80 to test it.

I never bought them because i never liked Samsung's UI.So overall happy but a 3 star rating for the device because of the defect inside one of the camera lens i don't know how that happened. But i am not happy seeing it. I know this is a low-budget phone. But i do not expect such carelessness from samsung. I know its a small thing and i can still take photos but i don't feel good that it's there.I wanted this phone urgently, i have use for it. So i cannot even replace this phone because I need it. Once the lockdown is lifted i will have to visit the service center.Such a good device. But a small thing that ruins the experience Samsung. I don't know how quality check misses this.\\n\", '\\n  Ultimate phone.Excellent finger print reader, display, battery back up is fantastic, speed of processor is like bullet, camera quality is excellent better than other brand s phone of even higher range, memory is more than enough, in this budget this mobile is incomparable with any other brand.I am writing this review after six months of usage.Must buy..\\n', \"\\n  This phone is very much similar to Samsug M30s. Some few differences include 20 MP front camera and android 10 in M21. First I bought M30s four month before and now I bought M21 because the price was lower by 2000/- compare to M30s.The phone performs decently in almost all aspects except battery backup. The M21 is giving highly disappointing battery backup. Even though Samsung claims that it is a 6000 mAh battery, it won't last for more than One & half day with normal usage like phone calling, messaging, WA and some banking or office apps.My M30s with same 6000 mAh, was giving (I lost it and so I bought M21) me the battery backup of 3 to 4 days leisurely.If battery life matters for you, don't go for M21, instead buy M30s only.\\n\", \"\\n  not satisfied at all. its front cam is pathetic which has filter by default, my redmi 5A, 3 year old phone worth 6999 takes much much MUCH BETTER photos than this disgusting ''Samsung smart phone''. There was an issue of switching on of hotspot which was sorted out after contacting the Samsung agent for around 39 min.  These phones are refurbished phones and not brand new phones which i didn't know and we cant return it as its not in the  policy, we can only replace them. LOL. well.....i just wanted a budget smart phone not COMPROMISE, which now i have to. My personal suggestion-if anyone wants to buy Samsung, buy it from the store not online coz these are not new and would definitely create problems.\\n\", \"\\n  1. I put the phone on charging, but it ran into a boot loop for no reason. Then I opened in factory mode. But after choosing to restart, it would again go in boot loop. Then I choose safe mode. But it did not come back to normal mode despite many efforts and restarts. The only way to restart it in normal mode was to format it. So, I had to.With my experience in the first month, I knew the phone is not stable. Nor it is reliable. So configured important folders for auto backup on Onedrive so I won't lose important photos and Data again.2. The battery is ok, yet I think not 6000mah. My 3 years old phone with 4000mah used to run for the same one day. It runs a few extra hours than the old one.Rest is no issue.\\n\", '\\n  After 1 month of usage this r my observations :)Pros:1) Excellent screen2) Great battery backup (u will have to tweak some settings to get the best battery backup).3) Decent camera performance.4) fast fingerprint sensor.5) Non-Chinese brand.Cons:1) Average processor.2) Poor Low light camera performance.3) Poor pubg performance.4) 15W fast charger is not enough takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the phone.5) No protective case in the box.Overall: If u r looking for a reliable Non-Chinese phones for day to day tasks and light gaming then just go for this phone.\\n', '\\n  I bought M21 (4gb, 64gb), delivered on 27th june. Notice a distinct yellow tint on display (whites are ivory). have tried multiple options: vivid mode- white balance, rgb tweak, adaptive brightness, dark mode, blue light filter off, no success. Tried to search a bit, looks a like lot of people are facing yellow tint issues with Android 10 UI 2.0. Samsung: is there a fix for this?. I have a S8+ (which luckily I cant upgrade to android 10). Screen tone of S8+ (whites are whites!) and M21 (ivory whites!) are quite different. Apart from this, proximity sensor working is intermittent, voice quality on video call is pathetic! Samsung, what do I do with this phone- return option not appearing/ replacement is showing..that too if smartchk app finds something wrong (these problems are not even listed). So all doors closed? Of all the problems, worst is the display..causing severe eye strain and headaches. As of now using at near zero brightness level. Suggestion to prospective buyers: pls look elsewhere! Samsung: please suggest a solution (for what its worth, I am regular Samsung customer, using 5 devices- mobiles/ appliances as of now). This one was a real disappointment! Kindly help!\\n', '\\n  An amazing phone, been using it for almost 20 days.Absolutely no unwanted Bloatware like the Chinese phones, an amazing Battery which lasts almost upto 2 days, with continuous WiFi Google meet and Zoom calls, Fair amount of E mails, Surfing and online streaming.Super fast Finger print scanner, very easy to setup. Solid build quality, with good look and feel of the phone.Good camera for the price point almost matches my iPhone XR. Super fast charging with Type C. Go for the 128gb version it makes more sense.This is any day better than the cheap Chinese copies on sale today.And oh yes forgot to mention this is 100% Made in India\\n', \"\\n  Face detecter -*****Fingerprint- *****Processor-*****Camera- ***** very much satisfy with camera performance..Gaming- 4gb is not for gaming..But as a multitasker this phone will satisfy you....Charger 'taking 2 hours to fully charged the phone..Overall phone performance eith battery backup os amazing... as per my personal opinion I am using this phone gor last 2 week....i noticed no problem means no lagging no screen burn .....worth it..value for money\\n\", \"\\n  After 3 days of use I am posting this, bought this phone for my wife who was using Redmi Note 5.Small things which is available in competition products with lesser or same price makes lot of difference. After 6 years of experience with Xiaomi we did lot of Research to change and chosen Samsung as preferred one.But am little disappointed with the performance here is pro's & cons.Pro's:1. Slim and very light to handle2. Audio output3. Lot of features inbuilt4. Battery backup ( comes 1&half day for moderate use)5. WiFi direct callingCons:1. >2 hrs charging time2. Doesn't feels like 48 megapixel & 20 megapixel front camera.3. Screen notifications are worst, you don't have screen led light blinking when any notifications come, so everytime you have to touch the screen to check for notifications.4.  Doesn't provide back case which competition does.5. Plastic back panel looks like ordinary phone for which you have to spend 16k.Overall not fully satisfied with this phone. As mentioned Samsung, has a big brand should small things should be implemented.\\n\", '\\n  Wow Samsung u r amazingHuge 6000mah battery with fast chargingI have 4gb ram and 64gb variantCamera is a beastGood battery life goes 1.5days with heavy playing game ,showing YouTube video ,chatting ,etc.Full charged around 2.5 hoursLight weightThanks Samsung and Amazon\\n', '\\n  Nice phone battery is good ,camera is ok  but lacks most options like samsung pass, mini pay compared to ASeriesTakes long hours to charge min of 2.5 hrs.My sincere request Is to not buy this model\\n', \"\\n  This product is good..I am student who got this phone for online classes every day  for 4hrs and 2hr 30min everyday tution plus my space 2hrsIt last for this full time.Continuously usingIt does get hotBut cools in some timeIt's been a more since I am using it perfect for me only thing no clipboard but downloaded it from Google keyboardCharging give an hour starting it loses it battery after a week it gets better and after the update on the phone its much better.I purchased a 4gb as well as a 6gbThis review is for the 6gbAnd this 6gb phone will last for 4to5 yearsAnd 4gb for 2to3 years6gb has more space than 4gb hence lifespan moreHope this gives u some idea about the phone..this is my honest reviewI hope this is helpful\\n\", \"\\n  I love this phone and currently have no complaints regarding it. But I would love even more if its sound quality would be better. The only thing I hate about this phone is the plastic body which seems too brittle to break, but it's quite strong enough. Its 6000 mAh battery is too long-lasting and could easily give you a battery backup of 1.5 days. I even play games on it and it can easily handle COD mobile and PUBG mobile on medium settings. But if you want to play on high-end settings, I won't recommend this phone. I got this deal at 12699 and compared to the price I have paid, I am completely satisfied. Thank you Samsung and Amazon for the best delivery experience as expected.\\n\", \"\\n  REVIEWING after 1 month.Bought it for INR 12,699. It took around 2 hrs to 2.30 hrs to get fully charged. Amazing display. Sound is equally good. I didn't try installing heavy gaming apps. Camera app has lot of features. Worth for money. That's all I would say.Pros:👍 Type C cable with fast charging.👍 Camera is excellent[support super slow motion videos].👍 Decent battery.👍 Super AMOLED display.👍 Comes with android 10.Cons:👎 USB cable is little short.👎 No earphone.👎 Lot of preinstalled apps like helo, tiktok,...\\n\", \"\\n  I bought this phone for my mother but used it for couple of weeks until I orderd Vivo z1x for myself. My mother is a casual gamer and plays light games. She also watches lots of videos and stream movies. And according to her needs I found this phone a perfect match at an unbelievable price (12699). I was looking for an amoled screen as it causes less strain on eyes.Display : Display is super awesome. Very bright and accurately colorful. I use Vivo z1x (Super amoled) and Samsung's display is far superior than of Vivo's. Daylight visibility is very good.Battery : Battery backup is excellent. It is easily giving 9 to 10 hours of screen on time. Charge it once and use it entire day without worry. Buttttt there is a major con, charging speed. It's 15w charger charges the phone very sluggishly. It takes almost 2 hours and 45 minuts to charge it fully.Camera : Camera performance is mediocre. It isn't great. Photos are good in daylight condition but things get bad in low light. Selfie Camara is also mediocre. Considering the price, Camara performance justifies the price.Sound : Speaker output is decently loud and clear. Headphone output is outstanding (because of Dolby atmos support).User interface : Phone runs on One UI android 10. It is majorly seamless with no lag. One UI is nice and feels premium. It has many customization options. There are no annoying ads or recommendations.Gaming : Phone performs excellent in light gaming. No major lag. Since my mother plays light games only, it serves the purpose well. Buttttt if you are a heavy gamer, please skip it without hesitation.Network : There is no issue in network or calling. Video streaming is also excellent. Good network reception.Cons :1. Sometimes finger print sensor is hit and miss. It annoys, you just keep rubbing your finger on the sensor and nothing happens.2. If you are a heavy user (who uses lots of games and apps) then phone will not feel smooth.3. Charging speed is very poor. In this fast lifestyle, it's very hard to manage with slow charging.4. Mediocre camera performance.5. Face unlock is bit slow and doesn't perform good in low light.Conclusion : I wanted to buy a phone for my mother and this phone fulfilled all the needs such as Amoled screen, big battery, decent processor, good sound output. Camera wasn't my priority. Overall very satisfied with the product.\\n\", '\\n  Samsung Phone purchased not at all a good quality product . in just 7 days, it is dead and no body even at customer service is responding us , they are saying it is used product and incorrect invoice  ,it is sheer waste of money.amazon agents are also misguiding .... even at call centre ,they have told us to wait, when the time for replacement gets over , they simply denied to help us old . we end uploosing rs 14000/- because of their wrong guidance.  i will not recommend anybody even to purchase any product from amazon , this is the third time that i am getting a such a  product .the product is defective and second hand ,low grade .battery got heat up like burning sensation , discharged early , touch pad is not working and got dead ,no response ,  a used ,second hand product .whoever is reading my review ,please do not buy from  here , they will cheat with you . you will end up paying and got loss .Samsung service engineer is saying ,do not buy from amazon , they are cheating people  and they are getting lot of complain regarding this now a days but refused to entertain us .we are in doldrums what to do next ..........kindly guide .\\n', '\\n  I have bought this smartphone around 3 month ago. Below is my experiencePros.1. Smooth amold display will blow your heart. You will definently like display and color of display.2. 6000mah Battary will provide you breakthrough performance. You dont need to charge again and again like other phone. Charge once and use whole day.3. Camera Obviously  48 mp back camera and 20mp front will provide you amazing photography experience i am not good in clicking pictures. Hence i uploaded some of photos. I belive you can do better than me.4. It have 4GB RAM so you can do multitasking eseily. No lag while playing PUBG or COD whith high graphics setting.5. If have game launcher which is amazing feature providing by samsung. Like it will track time spending on a single game, while playing if someone calling you will get very short popup to receive call or not.6. Again amazon sevice did great work even in lockdown. (5 out of 5).7. Manufacturing in india. And samsung relible brand.Cons.1. Charging time is too long even it have fast charging still you have to give 2hour to 2 hour 30 minute for full charging.2. I didnt like back side look but i still bought beacuse of feature and brand value and pricing.So overall my final rating is 4.7 out of 5. You should go for it.\\n', \"\\n  The phone has these positive sides :1. Great display. AMOLED is hands down better than any other technology.2. Great Battery life.3. Great software experience with ONEUI.4. Great form factor with low weight. samsung made the phone completely out of plastic to adjust for the wt of the battery.5. Type C charger.The bad parts:1. Speaker output could have been better.And that's it. It is a great phone with a great display- the actual thing u tend to look at all day round.GET IT and be HAPPY.\\n\", \"\\n  Rear camera 5 starsFront camera doesn't work well in low lightFingerprint reader is slower than other brand phones in this rangeFace lock is also slowBattery life is pretty good 5 starsBeautiful display 5 startsOS 5 starsAfter 4 months of usageBattery life is not made for gaming or mobile hotspot it's not a monster battery not even a little.Heats up crazy during gaming and extreme usage don't recommend sleeping next to it.Quality is not up to the mark for safety and performance reasons I don't recommend this phone to any young people.Camera quality is just ok. 3stars/5stars\\n\", \"\\n  I have been using this phone for the last one month and till now I did not see any technical defect in it.  This is Samsung's best budget phone so far.  I would like to give it a full 5 stars out of 5, with excellent emulated display, great processor, battery performance and camera quality.\\n\", '\\n  The Samsung M21 is a budget smartphone with professional features at a pocket friendly price. The smartphone has 48 MP camera that does justice to photos and videos. The phone has a dual sim which means it is like carrying two phones in one, without the need to lug two physical phones. The phone has VoLTE capability and supports the latest 4G SIM cards and protocols. The massive battery is a boon for those who need to keep on \"chatting/talking non-stop\". The fingerprint reader is located on the rear side and is extremely fast in responding to fingerprint recognition. It is a great buy at the given price. Go for it.\\n', '\\n  This my review after 4 days of purchase.  I bought this for my mother who is a teacher. She wanted a phone with screen recorder. As all classes are online for the past few months due to Covid teachers r taking online classes and submitting the same to their heads. As her old phone did not support recording on 2 mics I had purchased this phone as it is a non Chinese best brand. Butto my shock it does not support 2 mics and for her it is a waste. All other mid-range chinese phones support recording which is in built. I did not expect this from such a good brand.  This forces us to buy Chinese phones though we want to boycott Chinese products. I hope Samsung brings in a new update to correct this problem.\\n', \"\\n  Regualr updates are required to boost system and software  performance.Camera is awesome rear and front.Functions are smooth and buttery .Watching movies and videos are very pleasant.But Some of the bloatware and third party apps  like Helo,likee,etc are yuck and must not be preinstalled. Thank God We can uninstall  them.Go for it .You wont regret except for regular android updates. only Feb month software update is provided so far by default. DONT KNOW if they provide regular security update or not.But it's  performance is by far smooth and well.While Doing DUO video call I felt heating of phone.Let's  see if it is improved in next security update.Samsung should provide headphones,back cover, tempered  glass with phones at their end.Regards,Edit:31may 2020Yesterday  took 30/40 photos and my phone Galaxy M21 appeared hot.Photos were quite good.What astonished me is this phone's  battery management .It generally takes three days to discharge.Actually I am a moderate user So It's expected but want the same performance in future. Samsung's own EXYNOS processor needs overhauling in comparison  to qualcom snapdragon and media  tech..Will add further information in due course02 june2020YouTube playback is sometimes stuck which I Experienced two three times.Software update is major issue.My preused samsung headphone is not compatible with its Jack.Loose .So doesn't works it ought  to be.My Nokia is much better than this phone is every aspect.Not a single time Hang or stuck during any usage.Samsung's  main problem is its processor which is required to be reengineered.In 30 july2020 got an update which was done  vastly. It feels good when the phone is updated regularly since it removes glitches and boosts performance.Samsung is listening its consumers I guess so it is providing updates.What I see in this update is battery is draining  a little faster than before.I am satisfied.Samsung should provide earphone, backcover and screen guard with every models I reiterate.Regards,My review is being altered.for some days  this phone has gone unexpectedly unresponsive. Touch is hectic and the display panel is heated .Samsung has provided me used phone by Amazon. I swear I will never buy  and persuade anyone to buy Samsung mobile ever.\\n\", '\\n  So I hv used it now for two days and here are my reviews:phone is big enough at this range. Performance is great. There is a dark mode avalable for all android system which I really liked. I am more into camera and I will rate this camera 4. There is too much exposure for photos. But night mode is too good. THis is perfect for low light imaging. But it will overexpose, so u will have to reduce the brightness. Also normal video will zoom a bit which I dont like. But u can shoot it in wide view as well which gives it a different feeling. The pro mode of camera for photos is less adjustable but it can overcome these limitations very well.The battery certainly lasted about 1.5 day on average usage with games, photos videos etc. At this price I think this is a v good deal.\\n', \"\\n  Yes.Cost efficiency is what i would call the super trait of M21 to be.This is the worthiest set to be bought at around ₹ 15k. Best Battery capacity and display (super AMOLED!) at this rate. Decent chipset.Been using it for a month. And it, indeed, is very good in overall performance and is more cost effective than I thought. In fact more cost effective than all the Mid Range phones I've bought so far.A massive 6000mAh Battery will sustain the phone for minimum a day but to be honest it does not deserve the hype it got. Also inclusion of a faster charger would have made me happier. But im still happy man!It Does heat up a little bit while charging. But seriously manages to keep the cool even while heavy RAM usage.The design is not appealing coming with a plastic body. This is a small negative which is overshadowed by the remaining overwhelming positives of M21.The april 2020 update is good. Trust me.If ever there is an offer where there is a rate drop below 14000 for a 4-64 variant then go for it.\\n\", \"\\n  My own experience of 3 days:-Battery- not working good as expected 6000 mah,it's looks like 3500mah.Camera-this is pretty good ,image quality is good.Fingerprints-some times fails to read ir fingerprints otherwise it's good .Network- I'm facing network issues with this phone ,internet connection some time collapse,and also my relatives complaint that he can't able to call me,but I can call him(it's happening since 3 days when I insert my Vodafone 4g sim in my new phone....Otherwise performance is good.\\n\", \"\\n  All Parameters are excellent other than below mentioned Points I observed.-Battery Backup- with a normal Usage it will go from 100 to 35% (From 5am till 8pm), less than expected. Actually Some Background Apps consumes so much battery which can't be Disabled.-Camera is OK OK (Doesnt appear to be  48MP quality, there is no in depth clarity in pixels with artificial light), daylight quality is good.(Very very Slight Heating is always there), you can feel it in pocket.-You can't disable notifications related to auto update of apps.-Face Unlock doesnt works sometimes in little dim light,in Light it is good.-No option to display data speed over status bar.-Settings menu is little bit not user friendly. Little bit confusing.- My Backup from Google Drive could not be restored, as it was showing try again later, Tried two times but didn't work, you can only avail this option during setting it first time.Whats app Backup Restored.-Data speed was not good as it was in my last phone(just an Observation)\\n\", '\\n  I bought 6/128 gb variantscreen resolution, camera quality no doubt is awesome.Battery personally i dont geel like 6000mah coz i dont play games still get only 1 day backup..But one day is quite decent but not as of 6000mah.But facing some problems , i dont know it is only with me or with anyone else??Plz tell me anyone who bought it had this pblem or not..1. Every time I insert sd card , it shows a display with message that issue with sd card and format it.If i only insert sd card then there is no issue but the issue came when i insert both sd card and sim cards together..I cheked it many times ,all the time it shows same....I dont know what to do...2. Moderate heating of mobile near earpiece during charging..3. Some lag when i was doing screen mirroring...Plz tell anyone else having these problem or not..if yes then what he does ??If no then plz suggest what should i do..Replace the device as it is only 3 days old..\\n', '\\n  After 12 days of usesBattery okCamera goodGood product value of money\\n', \"\\n  I had been always buying budget phones from Chinese brands for my Parents until now. Then I heard about the new Samsung M Series range of phones making sensation in the market with Super AMOLED screen and good configurations for the price. Decided to give it a try this time and ordered the M21 for my dad. Upon receiving the phone, I was blown away by the almost everything this phone was offering in this price range. The screen quality is amazing with definite 2 days battery life. The performance of the phone is more than adequate and easily compares to any other sub 15k phones, but the camera quality, battery and the screen quality surpasses almost all others in this segment. The screen quality is better than even my twice expensive phone which is having IPS TFT panel.Pros:Great screenCamera qualityBattery backupPerformanceSoftware refinementCons:Weight. But its justifying given the massive battery size.Plastic Body. But to be frank, we use phones with cases. So in that case, plastic body is safer than glass. So not a con actually.No bundled earphones. That too can't be really complained in this price range and also currently, no one is supplying the same.Verdict:I am loving it more and my dad is also happy since its a Korean and non Chinese brand and Proudly Made in India phone. This purchase made me order an M31 for my mother the next day, since she is really keen on phone camera quality than my dad, and since this 13k phone amazing for its camera, was having even high hopes for an 18k phone which is having higher camera specs.\\n\", '\\n  I have been using this phone since 2 weeks.Pros1. Manufactured in India2. Display is really good. I can surely distinguish this from my old phone3. Battery life last more than a day even after high usage4. Dolby atmos sound enhances video and audio experience5. Camera is fantastic. Does a good job for a noob photographer like meCons1. Charging wire could have been little longer2. I miss led notification lightOver all Samsung has done a very good job in mid range segment. At this price I did not wanted to purchase some other brand with UI that is more like a adware\\n', \"\\n  Bought in Amazon india. As mentioned,product was made in India.Which I liked.Comes with ejector pin, travel adapter and usb, and manual with warranty.It supports fast charging. It was mentioned that The USB cable was made in austria. adapter made in India.Takes quite long process while initial start. Make sure that you select what you need.Pros1.Country of Origin-For buyers who look for Made in India phones,definitely you could get this.2.Battery suits for very normal users.3.security Mcafee comes with this. we need to turn on for security.4.Processor is ok.5.Super AMOLED display6.No heating issues.7.Android 10 with UICons1.Mono speaker.2.Camera light output is low. Camera wasn't appreciating. For this price camera design should have been better.3.Lot of preinstalled apps,which I don't like.4.Takes quite long time to charge. Even fast charging mode switched. This was unexpected.5.No headphones or screen guard provided. We need to buy separately.6.Dolby gets switched only when you use headset,bluetooth headset mode.ConclusionGood phone for normal users. I think it won't suit for heavy smartphone users.\\n\", '\\n  Just after 2 weeks of purchase, this Samsung M21 smartphone suddenly got hung and a portion of the screen is not responsiive. Immediately I  raised a complaint. The technical guy of customer care not even bothered to listen to the complaint. He just told that the return policy expired two days back, just two days and I dont even know about it. How can one expect that this kind of cheap goods being delivered to us. They can stop working at any time if they are too cheap. Amazon thinks the customers are like fools living in amazon forest. They should consider the complaint and need to respond in a constructive way. IN this pandemic matter of two days should be considered and extended.Apart from all these, the service is so bad and irresponsible. They are saying go to the samsung service centre. If we can go there why should one buy from your site? Because we believe better service from you irrespective of who the seller is. If its an offline purchase we should have checked every thing there itself physically. Since its Amazon we blindly ordered just by seeing images but later realized that it is also like ultra low grade e-marketing company after talking to this customer service guy. I just dont want to take his name. When I say how can we go out in this circumstances as ours is containment zone. He simply told not to order from amazon as they also cant deliver here. Amazon should seriously look into this guys behaviour. He is going to make you loose many customers.Finally, I suggest not to buy electronic products, particularly samsung brand from Amazon. Please go and buy offline. They are also suggesting the same indirectly.\\n', \"\\n  Good product by SamsungBut I think samsung is also going the way of other cheap China mobiles by selling our data. Maybe to tackle the competition?First time when I switched on and starting updates I found other party apps like like videos ,Facebook and other unnecessary  apps started to get installed without my permission.But later these things have to be removed  settings tweaked to tackle the problem and it was really tough.Wasn't expecting this from samsung.(may be they thought that this is low end phone so why to worry?)Camera is good for its priceFingerprint reader and face recognition lock are useless in this price tag as you know if u mind or security as a basic\\n\", \"\\n  \\xa0I Ordered this product on 28th july 2020 and recevied the delivery packet by 30th july 5:00pm (Delivery speed was good though.)I payed the order amt to delivery guy and after receiving the payment, he handed over me the phone. And full of curiosity i opened the delivery packet in front of  delivery guy.what i found is that phone box has all the accessories perfectly But the sad part is phone itself was missing.I mean did i just paid 13999 rupees for a samsung charger and a data cable and ofcourse the sim ejecting tool.Just warning you guys , maybe you won't even get the charger , data cable and sim ejecting tool .Be Careful While paying at this Product or even any other product from Amazon.So, this is the real face of amazon india services . this is their customer satisfaction and after sales service.I dont know that who was faulty at this , it can be the seller , delivery agency , or warehouse staff(as it was FBA product) . But the responsiblity of managing all of this goes to Amazon Only and that's why they charge high comission fees from sellers.\\n\", '\\n  Just purchased this phone as i had no other option as i dont support chinese product anymore.The picture quality of the phone is great but the phone starts hanging while using whatsapp. Even after using it for 15min the phone becomes heated . To disconnet the call you need to tap twice on the cancel  button.I had used Samasung Galaxy J7 few years back and it was my worst experience ever. I thought Samsung being such a big company might have improved the quality after years. But i was wrong.Strong suggestion to buyers....Never go for Samsung , keep it as a last option to buy.\\n', \"\\n  Purchased Galaxy M21 for sister as it is non-Chinese. But now I am regretting not buying other brand. Such pathetic M series was not expected from Samsung.Only gud thing abt this phone is Amoled display, large battery and decent camera.Rest everything is impractical...be it1. Plastic back- plastic back is finger print magnate and will get scratches easily.2.Rear fingerprint placement- fingerprint position is so upward that literally u need to find it . Also it is so flat with back body making diffictly in distinguishing fingerprint sensor with back body.3. Slow Processor- processor is slow/laggy. Phone started getting slow from 1st day of usage. Slow opening of app or buffering type slow response which irritates a lot.4. Heating issue- Most pathetic thing abt this phone is its heating issue. Means it will heat more at earpiece area only(upper part of phone). I have used other phones also...but samsung makes record among all in term of heating issue.5. No screen protector and phone cover- Many brands which are much cheaper than Samsung and gives equal quality at low price, include screen protector and phone cover but I don't know why Samsung is doing this. Now I will have to buy it separately.Overall I am disappointed with Samsung mid range phones as they are not made for practical purpose. It will not be wrong to say why brands like Mi, realmse got big boom over Samsung. They provide every practical need which we want.Sorry samsung but this will be my last purchase of samsung phone.\\n\", \"\\n  After around 2 months of using Samsung M21(6GB/128GB) phone it developed display problem..Also some network signal strength issues is seen after switching to this phone...I had to spend Rs 5484/- for changing display as they were telling display is not covered under warranty, many people are facing this issue. Better don't buy this phone.Fingerprint scanner is good Camera is average only.Battery will run for almost 1.5 days with single charging.\\n\", \"\\n  First I bought this phone as my old phone bricked and I needed one urgently. Only criteria was a not a made in china decently modern phone. This one a21 and 31 were trending in market though my research 6 months back wanted me to buy an a50 something these two had the same features CPU etc and processor but lesser ram and storage and one camera less and some megapixels lesser but who needs them anyway. All I need is one decent camera on each side.The camera in this is decent and has multiple modes and options like AR AI and wide angle and so on. Its confusing and I felt not in control. So sticking to 16:9 standard pics. Still the depth is pixelated even at 48 MP.The amoled screen is amazing in vivid colors though it can be quite hard on the eyes. I am keeping it in dark mode mostly and there is also a blue filter. There are also calm modes which put the phone in black and white and do not disturb mode for me time  away from phone.The phone is quite bulky by today's standards about a centimeter with a cover. It doesn't have 5g support either which many new phones bring.This is a mostly made in india phone with exception of charger cable from Vietnam and I am sure the processor and circuits made in Taiwan or china. Nevertheless it was refreshing to see a made in india phone designed by Samsung in a world where anything we buy is made in china. Though I must say the finish of the product and packing is not of such high quality as chineese brands like xiaomi vivo not even compare to one+. But the product itself is of higher quality than chineese phones.The cost is much higher than normal times perhaps due to pandemic or import curbs from china. Atleast 4k more. Such phones are in the 10k range but still feature to feature similar prized mi or others have more cameras and glass body and many more features. Brought this only cos of Made in India.but it has to become  competitive in terms of quality and price to be successful.Update: After a weeks use updating to 5 star. 3 day battery though no real fast charging takes 3 hrs to charge full. Performance is top notch no lag or hang and smooth even with extra animations enabled. Overall happy with the phone.\\n\", '\\n  Pros:1. I got this mobile against exchange which was good deal2. I also got approx 1200/ addnl deal wrt bank3. Excellent budgeted smart phone In this price range4. 6.4-inch/Super Amoled/FHD / Resolution (2340 x 1080) and 16M color support5. Triple Camera - 48MP Main Camera +8MP Ultra Wide Camera +5MP and 20MP front camera6. Android with  10.0 operating sys 1.7GHz Octa-Core processor, 6GB RAM, 128GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB and dual SIM- 4GCons:1. It’s not 5G handset2. Battery Charger is ordinary ( no quick charger) neither wattage is mentioned on charger- disappointing3. Ear phone is not a part of box which is disappointing.4. Face ID not avlble5. Samsung should limit number of apps that comes with handsets. This unnecessarily lowers down the speed as well storage.\\n', \"\\n  Battery life is the main USP of this M series, camera quality is not upto expected but at this price range seeing the other specs the little camera quality can be compromised and if you can really want a good camera then go for M31 or M31s . samsung gives the best amoled display it's a no brainer. Fingerprint is very fast , face unlock is good but not at best but fingerprint unlock works really fast, phone runs smooth as well I'm not a gammer so don't know about that , there is little heating issue only while charging the phone , otherwise I haven't noticed heating issue, the phone comes with minimal blootware that's the best , it is not like any Chinese brands like MI , oppo , realme where you notice adds , so in this samsung one UI there is a near to a stock android experience without blootware and adds and that's very good as well\\n\", '\\n  I loved this phoneThis has pure samsung flaship level touchresponse.Amoled display is amazing.Battery is amazing.And apart from all theseLook very expensive one in black color .Camera is good .Not heating .Network reception is amazing .Call quality is good .Speaker is good.Its like you hold jewel in your hand .This fone doesnt looks like cheap smartphones like redmi xaomi and real me .Build quality is amazing .If you are not a gamer then go for it under 20k .This is best smartphones and cheapest from samsung.I have recently used realme xt but that one also not feels expensive in your hand .In every aspect this fone is far above the chineese fones.And UI is amazing like you will never get that feeling from any other chinees brand .Amazing fone go for itThink twice before going to choose chineese brand if u r not a gamer .I loved it .\\n', \"\\n  Do you want an android phone?Do you've a higher perceived brand value for Samsung?Is your budget under INR 13K?If your answer for all of these is YES, then do not wait, just buy it !*** The Processor Debate ***This Snapdragon Vs. Exonys Vs. Mediatek etc, this is all just topics of debate for youtubers. They need content for their channels, don't put your mind in tizzy unless you are a heavy gamer and your life depends on nano-seconds of lag.Yes all these processor debate end at the difference of nano seconds which in real life is even way beyond blink and miss. You can't notice it even if you are Rajnikant. So chose a phone which is VFM for you.*** Perceived Brand Value of Samsung ***Lets just put it out here, Samsung is the Apple of Android world. Right or wrong ? 100% Right !!For me, i always recommended Xiaomi phones to folks who want innovation on a budget. But if you want and Apple but one running Android then Samsung is best bet for you.*** Durability ***Samsung phones are durable and so are even MI phones. I have one Mi A1 still working in mint condition used by my mother. So your decision making should be based on the brand value doe you.*** Battery ***One thing Samsung has learnt for its entry level and mid level offerings is to rightly capture the need. People need large capacity batteries because mobile phone has become one of our limbs, extension of our body part.Added benifit : decent camera , 3.5 mm jack.*** To Summarize ***If you do not want a Xiaomi or Real Me or Moto because you want a SAMSUNG, then go for it, because**** it has massive juice to last**** oh you've a SAMSUNG*** take those 🤳 selfiesTo suarize\\n\", '\\n  After several research and watching many you tube videos related to drop test and other stuffs bought this mobile but I regret for buying this mobile, just dropped the mobile by 2 feet height, the so called gorilla  glass broke into pieces. Very worst manufacturing just the brand name is getting marketed and sold but product is of cheap quality. Pls also see the pics of broken glass before you decide to buy. My old redmi note 4 is far better in terms of build quality.\\n', '\\n  I have been using a smaller 5\" form factor phone for almost 3-4 years. Had been wanting to buy my next phone for quite some time and finally bought this one.And I would say I\\'m content with the it.It has a vibrant display best in class I would say. I don\\'t notice the U notch for sometime of usage.Good speaker not something loud but good enough.Good cameras for the price! Some might find the selfie camera less impressive but its good enough for social media needs.Excellent battery! Better than all those 1000$ phones! 😁And the performance is fine enough for me, I get some lags here an there but nothing which makes trouble in my daily tasks. I would say the performance is same as compared to my old phone S6 Edge, which is good as it still runs smoothly! 😁 Btw, I don\\'t game much!!Perfect to gift it to your mom, dad or anyone in your family. It has good big fonts. And no bogus softwares you might see in other brands!I would say I made a right decision to not invest in a premium phone and saved a lot of money. This phone gets everything done I need and I believe most users will find it good enough too!\\n', '\\n  One of the best in market* sAMOLED 6.4 is delivering high satisfaction  Display is big, good, sharp, crisp and clear  enough, Bright colours.  one of the top reason  to go for M21*Dolby atmos gives amplified audio output* Battery is like ocean* Camera is Crystal Crisp* Fast enough* Best in budget* Video experience is just wowBut also know itBody is plastic but glossy , looks goodThe frame finishing does not give a luxurious feel. But a good cover can do that, anyways you will use a cover to protect it. So this reason should no stop you from getting M21.But when you use It, overall performance is going to be satisfying. 200 % recommend this mobile\\n', '\\n  Overall the phone is excellent at this price point.  You cannot go wrong with it.The pros1) Superb 6.3\" display with SuperAMOLED : This is really great to have. There are many higher end phones which are pricier, but every time you view on your phone the display is something that goes beyond its segment2) Awesome battery: I believe this is something very important far more than only performance.  Can be a life saver during the occasional instance when you have forgotten to charge it.  Till now  with most never dropped below 30% charge.  Have a reserve charge is good.Also:  The 15W fast charger is fast enough unlike what people believe.  Just don\\'t wait to charge it until its fully discharged.3) One UI on Android 10 and processor performance: Samsuns\\'s OneUI is decent and consistent now across devices. It looks modern and works without lags. Ofcourse its not a gamer or performance phone. But the Exynos 9611 processor is good enough for most tasks for most people.  Also I am sure Samsung will update to Android 11 and maybe even 12.4) Sales and Service: Not much direct experience, but I see that the service center availability is so much better than my previous phone (ASUS Zenfone)5) Signal Reception and SAR: Having a low SAR value is important . WIFi and call reception is excellent. Speaker is loud and clear.Cons:If I have to pick one con for this phone, its the camera. Its average - if I compare it to the ASUS Zenfone 3, a older phone - but then ASUS specializes in the camera area.So camera is average just like most phones at this price point .\\n', \"\\n  Performance of the phone is good so far. The finger print scanner is is indeed very fast but the best thing I like about this phone is its super amoled display; it is a treat to watch videos on this phone. Camera I personally don't use much, but the quality of front and rear cameras is pretty good especially the night mode which is very helpful in taking pics in low light.Looks good in hand and it is very lightweight which is an added advantage. Now the storage of 128 GB of which 100 gb is at your disposal which practically eliminates the need for external storage for an average user like me. Sound quality is also good and you can listen to your favourite music anytime.The only drawback is battery which as mentioned 6000mAh doesn't seems to be working as long as it should. It still manages to get 36 hours of usage after full charge which takes almost 2 hours with the fast charging feature.Overall considering the price range it is a very good phone with all the necessary features packed in a compact and lightweight device for the average user.\\n\", '\\n  I had purchased Samsung Galaxy M21 6GB RAM 128 GB on 3rd July. Model is good, sAmoled display good. Battery performance best. Fast Charging good. But the processor not good for gaming. I have installed Asphalt 8 car game, mobile is lagging sometime evenI have 6GB RAM model. You can use mobile for all things except Gaming. I hope Samsung will think on it and changed their mobile processor.\\n'], 'url': 'https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/dp/B07HGJJ559/ref=sr_1_13?dchild=1&fst=as%3Aoff&pf_rd_i=6308595031&pf_rd_m=A1K21FY43GMZF8&pf_rd_p=2c2b4d9e-f15e-4cf3-8e5c-acf68c668c41&pf_rd_r=80WR7NYVY11014AWK7F7&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_t=101&qid=1601263641&refinements=p_85%3A10440599031&rnid=10440598031&rps=1&s=electronics&sr=1-13', 'category': 'Mobile', 'destination_urls': ['https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A0789677KRMPAXGBRXRR&qualifier=1602309871&id=7550498744818920&widgetName=sp_detail&url=%2Fdp%2FB08J3D1NKS%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB08J3D1NKS%26pd_rd_w%3DnSkwm%26pf_rd_p%3D1801b34c-8af9-42b5-8961-11f124edc99b%26pd_rd_wg%3DPajLM%26pf_rd_r%3D5PE253H65BZ8DBC2J65Z%26pd_rd_r%3Df5178414-bcaf-4067-8313-f96ce0390990', '/Exchange-Pick-up-Service-for-Mobiles/dp/B07P9BW77B/ref=bmx_1/262-4078378-8239236?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07P9BW77B&pd_rd_r=f5178414-bcaf-4067-8313-f96ce0390990&pd_rd_w=PFvrN&pd_rd_wg=PajLM&pf_rd_p=08abe11d-4ee5-46ca-8471-7bf18c53fc91&pf_rd_r=5PE253H65BZ8DBC2J65Z&psc=1&refRID=5PE253H65BZ8DBC2J65Z', '/YOFO-Shockproof-Transparent-Cover-Samsung/dp/B07YZJDWSC/ref=dp_sdpd_dis_1/262-4078378-8239236?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07YZJDWSC&pd_rd_r=f5178414-bcaf-4067-8313-f96ce0390990&pd_rd_w=Ntff6&pd_rd_wg=PajLM&pf_rd_p=e8f8a292-d03d-4d46-bc19-4115263d4fed&pf_rd_r=5PE253H65BZ8DBC2J65Z&psc=1&refRID=5PE253H65BZ8DBC2J65Z', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A0789677KRMPAXGBRXRR&qualifier=1602309871&id=1115229570440216&widgetName=sp_detail2&url=%2Fdp%2FB08J3D1NKS%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1']}, {'_id': {'$oid': '5f815873aaa28c53dfe2b475'}, 'description': 'Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery', 'price': '₹7,499', 'rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars', 'review_count': '22,967', 'reviews': ['\\n  \\xa0Defective product shipped.. reported within a  few  hours of receipt and no one showed up for inspection despite several follow ups.

Earlier ones were good.But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.Not recommended.Would love to return but it was gift for family,\\n', \"\\n  I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).\\n\", '\\n  Mobile is good at this priceBut when I was using hotspot and screen recording the mobile became overheated it hanged so i switch off it.In this range mobile is really good..\\n', '\\n  We are highly unsatisfied with the product .There is performance issue with the phone in which the touch ,speed as well as the processor is very slow.It does not worth the money and the sound quality is also low.The battery also gets drained very early though it is of 5000 mAH.We have mailed a return request but they have not taken any action.I need to return this phone and want a new phone as soon as possible.\\n', \"\\n  The phone hangs a lot.

You can fix this bug by System Update.Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment.Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic.RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.No Heating Issue: I'm not a gamer, but if you are an average you will not find any heating issue, at least most of the time.\\n\", \"\\n  I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews!Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review.\\n\", '\\n  Pros:*Cool battery*Type c charger and fast charging*Corning Gorilla glass 5(toughness)*Splashproof*Wireless FMCons:*Too many pre-installed unwanted apps which would kill internal storage and ram space*No private safe, but covered with second space.

Total waste of money.\\n', '\\n  Redmi 8A Dual 3gb 32gb..Mobile average performance..Not available Fingerprint Reader..Battery life performance also average 5000Mah Battery not going full 2 day with normal usage..Camera quality is also average not upto mark..No slow motion video.. not more option..And main thing so many adds on apps unnecessary  getting notifications...Totaly average performance..But good thing is this mobile getting USB TYPE C & Fast Charging Support is available...\\n', \"\\n  Posting reviews after using it for 1 month:Cheap quality intarnal materials used ex. Camera sensor, bluetooth, etc.Realized after experiencing following unexpected problems:- screen hanging- bluetooth not connecting now, earlier connecting when it was- leaves the marks/shadow of the icons/screen elements used in previous applications or even after accessing the contacts or any content.- mobile charger gets heated up like anything after 5-10 min of chargingQuality getting cheaper as the number of users increasing. Company only eye on maximizing the profits. That's what the conclusion is.\\n\", '\\n  The phone does not boot up. I am not sure what quality check has gone into the product. unfortunately I was not able to return the product on time and the return window got lapsed. Now I am running at the MI brand store to get the product replaced. I spoke with amazon customer care and the seller and they were not willing to replace the product as it got out of the window. What good is a phone if it does not even boot up, What quality testing was done on the phone. Worst exp with amazon and with the seller. I was asking them for replacement as I could not ope n the product on time due to medical issues.\\n', \"\\n  I had this Smartphone for my mother. Now after using it about 15 days , I can assure you that Xiaomi has arranged a great deal , but by the time passes new Smartphones will be it's competitors. So remember it's time and current scenario I can completely recommend you to buy this phone if your budget is below 10k .I had ordered 3gb+32gb sea blue variant and got delivered within 5 days , thanks to Amazon. The phone supports 18 watt fast charging and has 5000 mah battery and face unlock , which are unexpected in this price range. But Snapdragon 439 processor is not eligible to do any hard work . I would recommend to use this phone for basics.\\n\", \"\\n  Important tip: Buy 3GB version to run free fire and other apps without any lags (Available Ram 2 GB/3GB).●Mobile is very good without any lags till now. (using Messenger, Whatsapp, gaana app simultaneously).●Don't buy this mobile for playing high config games. Processsor and graphics hardware are of average quality.●The battery is huge in this mobile. Charging with realme 20W charger took around 2 hours (10% to 95%).●The front and back camera is good in this price segment, and don't expect a quality like 15k mobiles.●The screen comes with a corning gorila 5, with no extra thin screen protector which other phones has.●Face unlock is good but sometimes doesn't work in low light. That is completely ok in 8k mobile.●Now the main thing which I don't like on this phone is useless apps which can't be uninstall. (like MiPay, MI secure vault, etc MI apps). And we can't trust these apps as government banned many MI apps because Xiomi read  and store every activity you do with those apps. So only use google apps to secure data and personal details. BTW it is still not reliable because MI11 OS also can read all your data. Some MI apps has own T&Cs which no one reads before opening. So use Xiomi phones carefully and don't store any banks information or passwords.\\n\", '\\n  Defective product. Started auto shutoff and on after just completion of return date. I have purchased it on 12th July 2020. Problem started from 25th July and surprisingly 24th July was last date to return. Very much disappointed. I am purchasing so many products from Amazon. They should check thoroughly before delivering at the cost of their reputation.\\n', \"\\n  The phone is good for the average user. I can say the one who needs streaming apps, whatsApp, Facebook and similar other app will love the phone. Everything is as per expectation. Would have surely liked the product if it was made in India. The model I received is Made in China. Battey backup is good. I am not into much of camera but it comes with 13MP which is good from business point of view.Face recognition is working 7/10 times. No fingerprint scensor. But it's okay for few people like us. Storage is more than enough with 53GB. And 3 GB RAM works well with all apps I mentioned.\\n\", \"\\n  This is the third Xiaomi product I'm purchasing but this time I'm highly disappointed. 8A phone is no different than Redmi 7A except that this is quite bulky to hold and has better battery life and comes with a C-type charger. Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.\\n\", \"\\n  I have upgraded from 7a to 8a, this series was released just three months after the earlier version.The battery🔋 which is 5000mah doesn't seem to be showing lot of difference from the 4000mah on the previous 7a. The only negative being the weight of the phone is a little heavier than the previous one. The blue color looks great but the phone is not easy to hold, you have to add back cover with a grip.Camera is good but the front camera has a lot of AI in it. When I took a picture with the back and front camera, the front looked too bright with a lot of brightness.Call quality is very good and it sounds almost like Nokia quality. Videos look good.  I have dropped my old phone a few times with absolutely no damage to body or phone function. I don't use the face lock so can't comment\\n\", '\\n  Product is working slowly. Keyboard not working properly. Was trying to return the product, showing is not eligible. Product was delivered on 4th March. Within a month all these issues are coming up. Feeling really bad.\\n', '\\n  Likes1. Screen size and qwality2. Battery3.

Best part is battery back up & USB Type C charging port with fast charging options available. Not satisfied with the face unlock feature. Can be considered as a good option for secondary handset, overall a value for money product.\\n', '\\n  Battery is okCamera is goodBut missing warranty cardWhy cheated like this fruaders\\n', \"\\n  I have read the reviews before buying the mobile. So thought to give it a luck. After using for 1 day the mobile screen keep on touching itself from any part of the screen. The phone hangs a lot. Pubg runs good at times but a lot of time it lags. I checked the battery performance in setting, the screen itself consuming more than 94% of battery which makes battery drain rapidly. I have replaced it. Now got a replacement with tampered mobile box. However the packing was not tempered. To my surprise it is a used mobile. Fingerprint of former user was found on mobile screen and charger. The mi seal was broken and re-pasted and delivered to me. The seller think himself oversmart. Keep distributing used mobile to the customers. I have checked this mobile condition which is good at outside but the internet connectivity is very poor it does not go beyond 350kb at 2am midnight Jio 4G. Which goes beyond 2Mbps at this time in other mobile phone. Also charger is heated up when charging within 20 minutes and it's not 18W power charger. So i got a defective used product in replacement.  Now i  want my refund. I am not satisfied with this mobile. The conclusion is that if you are lucky enough than this mobile will work for a few day until replacement period is over or maximum 15 days later you will repent at your choice. Better put 1-2k more and get better mobile than this Redmi 8A Dual 3-32.\\n\", \"\\n  The phone is beautifully designed, including the patterned plastic back and the dewdrop notch design. the battery life is good but it could be better but since it's miui,there isn't much you can get apart from ads in the UI which are hard to turn off,there's a lot of invasive bloatware and adware,also the camera quality is average,there was no need for a dual cam setup(I feel the lower camera can be fake),the front cam is average too,I think should've gone with the 9i. Also, there's no screen protector or cover in box\\n\", '\\n  In products detailed information it is mentioned, product would be made in India, but why delivered product is made in China. I know company is from China, however I thought product is getting manufactured in India. Please put correct information in product details.\\n', '\\n  Ok phone. Brought as I got good exchange price of my old phone against purchase of redmi 8a dual. Speed ok. Phone hangs sometimes. Camera ok. Call quality and battery life superb. Display very good for budget phone. One defect. IR blaster is not working on my redmi 8a dual since day one. One irritating this that MI asks permission to store data and track for almost everything we use on this phone. Would rate it ok purchase as I got for only 3000 in exchange of my old phone.\\n', '\\n  Simple smartphone, but Good Smartphone! Camera average but included PRO mode, Battery backup excellent Charged 4 days ago. Used normal internet and Dual 4G native video calling and WiFi Hotspot without gaming till now.

Overall 9/10 but if you consider the price then it\\'s 10/10 actually.\\n', \"\\n  Battery life is good but as it is not fast charging, it takes 3-4 hours to charge completely. It looks really good as well...and so far it's performance has been amazing. Camera is good as well. Overall it's an excellent phone in this price range.But do refer to it's YouTube review as well. All of its features and deficiencies are explained in detail there.\\n\", '\\n  The Budget BeastNo words to describe the new Redmi 8A especially its stunning look ... amazing display with water drop notch looks premium. This design is seen only in 15 k segment from Samsung where Xiaomi did it.Awesome cameraI have used 4A & 7A but comes to 8A its totally changed in camera. Its AI powered camera gives excellent output even in low light conditions  worth it...oooohIncredible Battery but not hulky5000 mAh class leading battery gives approximate two days of normal use without charging twice. Not much bulky in hand and weight is optimized!!!!! wowperformance is out of the worldGames, movies, chatting, shooting no compromise on multitasking Smoothly run by octa core chipset from Snapdragon 439 is excellent at this price point is amazing....octa core at 6K OMG....main disadvantage I have noticed is there is no notification led...\\n', '\\n  - utmost thing is battery backup- camera is too good at good light condition- low light camera is blurry- speakers are good at sound- there is double tap for screen wake- the VoWifi(Voice over WiFi) is available for selected operators- network reception is also good- phone is little bit heavy- it will good if here is LED notificationat last i would say the phone is best value phone from Xiaomi But there UI bugs are ridiculous\\n', '\\n  Good mobile for the price you get. SD439 does the day to day job, definitely gaming is not amongst those. Camera is what you get for the price. The highlight is battery which is absolutely killer. Can easily give a screen on time of 10 plus hrs on mixed usage. Supports fast charging however only 10 watts charger is supplied in the box and,without any headphones which is understandable at this price.\\n', '\\n  There is one feature of this phone wherein we can tab three times on screen to see zoom view; when I enabled that, I found lagging issue with phone and also screen got freeze some times, with this option face diffuculty to dial a phone when we need to type like 9998 it\\'s my own number series,Camera performance disappoint me; in day lite it\\'s Ok, I can say average, and in night compete zero..\"0\", and color capturing is also not good.I am happy with design, that gives rich look, touch is smooth, also allows to delete preinstalled games & other application.It\\'s okay with this price and No cost EMI option.Thank you\\n', \"\\n  Good budget mobile for basic usage like attending online classes, listening to music, watching videos and normal browsing. The limited 2 GB RAM doesn't allow for multitasking and gaming which you obviously can't expect in a phone at this price. The features are really amazing like the p2i coating, Gorilla Glass 5 and wireless FM which makes this a strong and durable phone to have!\\n\", '\\n  Did lot of research before buying.At this budget this the best phone I found it in market. I am not big fan of redmi. But it is cost effective and good for short term use.Over all phone is okay don’t expect much .Sound quality is good.Battery life is also good.Have all the required basic features.Camera is not that great if you need good camera dont go for it.Phone is heating while charging.Go for it if it fit in your budget.Overall okay.\\n', '\\n  Redmi 8a dual is the worst mobile in the market. The phone has serious lag issues and the home page freezes from time to time. I got a replacement after I complained about lag issues and the second piece turned out to be worst than the first. Now I am stuck with this \"brick\" of a mobile forever. After a complaint about the replacement, Amazon sent a service expert who was unaware of my phone\\'s problem. He came, he saw, he yelled, he blabbered and left telling that the phone is fine according to him and that I have 365 days time to keep visiting the Mi service centre day after day.\\n', '\\n  It’s just not worth the money. I have used MI phones earlier and they work fine but this one is useless.1) it’s very slow and if you open multiple app at a time the phone will hang2) Even opening YouTube application on this phone takes close to 8-10 seconds3) Battery is very and will last appx 1 day with normal usage4) lot of ads pop up which is irritating5) Camera is very bad , My earlier MI 5A takes better pictures than this phoneOverall very unhappy with this product.I have been using this since 10 days now.\\n', \"\\n  The phone got slow after one week use, i wanted to replace but the replace window is closed. Camera & battery are average, It's not like 13MP & 5000Mah. The device is not suitable to play any game even ludo, it's started lagging when you open ludo and after shut any from your app your home display become blank for few seconds ...........Worst experience.Dear Amazon team, please help to replace the device.\\n\", '\\n  निश्चित रूप से रेडमी ने अपने आप को काम कीमत में बेहतर फीचर्स एवम् क्वालिटी मोबाइल कंपनी के रूप में स्थापित किया है परन्तु कॉम्पटीशन के चक्कर में रेड़मी ने सस्ते पार्ट्स इस्तेमाल करना शुरू कर दिया है। यही वजह है कि रेडमी के फोन्स की क्वालिटी घटती जा रही है। Redmi 8a में mike की घटिया क्वालिटी इसका एक नमूना है। मै redmi 8a के 5 से भी ज्यादा फोन में वही same mike problem देख चुका हूं। Vioce क्लियर नहीं आती । Feels like old days chinese mobile phone।प्लीज खरीदने से पहले एक बार किसी भी दूसरे के मोबाइल को इस्तेमाल करके देख लें । Totally disappointed this time\\n', \"\\n  Bought the phone for my wife when her phone screen was damaged. It was on offer on Amazon at the time and for its price, it seemed like a great deal. Note that the spec says 2GB ram, 32GB storage. Being a Samsung user, i wasn't sure how the experience would be. However i am happy to report that aside from a few hitches, this phone is excellent. The 2GB may seem less but i never noticed any issue when using fb or youtube. I cannot recommend it for intensive gaming but for casual use like watching videos etc, it is fine. I havent tested the selfie cam yet but the front cam is pretty good. There is no fingerprint sensor. Even though the phone supports fast charging, there is no fast charger provided. No earphones. Basically just the phone and regular charger. Ensure you remove the preinstalled bloatware and banned chinese software. Finally an excellent 5000 mAh battery that lasts almost a whole day on active use. All in all, a phone perfect for the casual user.\\n\", '\\n  6:25 inches screen with HD display,gorilla glass 6 smooth swipe and touch gesture,though it has an AI technology the camera is average overall and good budget phone comes with android 9 (pie) though  like the oreo version more overall a good budget phone\\n', '\\n  Ordered it for my mother. Good phone for her but for average user it is not that good.Cons:Phone keep hanging if multitasking done like opening of 2 or more apps at same time.Battery life is also not so good.Built Quality and finishing is not good.Pros:SnapDragon processor at this range.Handy phone.\\n', \"\\n  I bought this Phone #MIDNIGHT GREY so that I can review it and post it on my youtube channel and found good so gave it to my grandmotherSo let's start reviewing with pros and consPros:-1) #BIIIIIIGER BATTERY:- Yes u have read it  right, It comes with a great battery life  of 5000 mah battery2) #CAMERA:- It comes with rear dual 📷  13mp+2mp, yeah it's good @ this  price, Selfie camera is also good3)  #CHARGING:- It comes with a Type-c charger and support upto 18w fast charging..

I have tried the trial on two mi 8 phones pic attached of both.. Samsung and Huawei phones with 3 gb are best it was my first mi phone and I m disappointed with this phone. I was using huawei and Samsung 3 gb ram varient and are best till date after more than 2 years of rugged usage. Even micromax 4311 3gb ram is faster than miI suggest to go for Samsung. mi is best for those who have not used Samsung and huawei(including honor) ram and battery management is best in Samsung, micromax and huawei\\n', \"\\n  First I ordered this mobile on 6th July and got it on 9th july(2020). There was 3.5 mm jack issue with this mobile and I ordered for it's return.Again I got a new mobile on 13th July but I can return my mobile till 20th July.On 22nd July I faced another issues with this new mobile. Apps opening and closing itself. Nither I can close my app nor I can switch off mobile. For example if I'm surfing fb then it suddenly get closed and suddenly open. Even mobile automatically start typing in comment box.So I just want to tell you pls don't go for this mobile.\\n\", \"\\n  It's a little hard to use with one hand, and the keyboard doesn't seem to have one-handed mode, but the split screen feature and the screen brightness make up for that. This is the first smartphone I've used where the minimum brightness is satisfactory for use in a dark room. The dark mode and reading mode options are quite helpful, too. The screen is also resistant to damage, to a certain extent. The battery cannot be removed, but there seems to be a fair amount of ingress protection because of that. Lastly, it comes with its own USB-C charging cable, which is a little short but charges well enough.\\n\", \"\\n  Lots of useless manufacturer and google apps. You open the box and it feels like you're using someone else's phone. Additionally, they cant be uninstalled. Hogs up 14 GB of 32 GB space and you're left with only 18 GBs. And if you're using two sims you cant even insert a memory card to store pics/music or whatever.Ads everywhere! You open any of their apps, even the system apps, and adds are there to greet you.Does not come with a fingerprint senser.Battery life is decent but lets see how it works 6 months from now.Has an ugly(imo) screen tint as default. And for some reason, every time I restart I have to set the tint and turn off auto-brightness all over again.  Idk if it's a fault or I am not doing it right.Screen guard and back cover not included in the box as is the norm with some other manufacturers.Comparing it with Honor 8c which I bought last year for roughly the same price (8.3k), this phone's resolution is massively inferior to Honor's even though they both claim it to be 720 x 1520 pixels.Very disappointed and underwhelmed with this purchase. Only keeping it because it was the cheapest phone (among newer releases) in the 32gb/3gb category on amazon. You save your money to buy an entry level phone and still it doesn't feel personalised. Fed up with these proprietary devices. Linux mobile distros cant come soon enough.\\n\", \"\\n  Redmi 8a dual is a balanced phone in its price rangeAdvantages...1. Processor is SD2. Display3.build quality4. battery life5. Face unlock6. Type c charging fast chargingDisadvantages...1. Front and rear camera quality is not up to the mark. It is slightly below avg quality. I hope redmi can fix it by software update.2. Picture stabilization is not up to the mark.3. Sound quality should be given slightly better.4. I have big issue with interface miui. There are a lot of adds.5. Some deadly apps come with pre installed. Those garbages should be removed by software update.Overall if you are looking for a low budget phone for your parents usage purpose or child's study purpose, this is the right one battery is larger, processor is good for day to day life usage and display is much better. Face unlock is fast. But redmi should Remove the garbage apps. Overall 4.5 star for the phone below 8k.\\n\", \"\\n  Nice phone, as expected. Only negative side is that it belongs to a Chinese company and a part of our payment will reach the Chinese (though made in India).Only Sub 10K price range phone with snapdragon processor and 64GB phone memory.Phone don't have fingerprint unlock, but have face unlock.Battery lasts for 2 days for average normal use (calls, social media and youtube, without gaming)Camera also good, with decent portrait mode with background blur and all the gimmicks.All in all a good budeget phone.Still i am a little upset that i supported the Chinese (even though indirectly)\\n\", '\\n  If u want to buy a phone with ₹7000 budget this is the best phone....Awesome battery life .....speakers are good ....coming to camera I give 3.5/5...not too bad or not too good ...but money worthy\\n', '\\n  When it comes to budget mobile phones with latest features u cant go wrong with Xiaomi phones. This model is  one such example. You get Good battery, Gorilla screen, big screen size (very big so some 1) etc. Overall value for money!\\n', '\\n  I bought this product with exchange, exchanged with old redmi 5. The pick up guy verified the mobile in and out and picked up from home. Surprisingly after one day he called and said glass is broken which we never noticed. And am sure it was not. We cant say what he did in 1 day with mobile. Now asking to return. It is not acceptable, i do not know wht all he did with mobile. If it was broken he could have rejected during pick up. This what i do not like..\\n', '\\n  I purchased this product only cause my one plus was broke and I couldn’t get it repaired on time. I needed a spare phone for emergencies and I bought this product considering the cost factor. I’ve never used any of RedMi products and since RedMi claim that they are the products for cost I wanted to give it a try. As I expected, it’s the worst performance phone. I’m not talking about the performance equal to a premium smartphone. I’m talking about basic use. The touch is worse. It taps automatically and makes the usage of phone a nightmare. Have to restart it multiple times to fix that issue temporarily. U never know when the same error occurs. Other than that, major thing is “THE DEVICE TURNS OFF ALL OF SUDDEN FROM NOWHERE AND WONT TURN ON AT ANY COST”. Nobody knows why that happened and will have to factory reset the device from device factory mode. Will never buy any of the RedMi products just because of price. I’d rather get a good quality product even if I have to pay a little more money.I’d not recommend at all be it any product coming from this company.\\n', '\\n  \\xa0I dislike the phone because fingerprint reader so poor that after few times it start becomes blur and screen got shake automatically and poor camera quality.

But this product is absolutely useless. My all other phones are brought from Flipkart and other sites. But none of them are of this kind. All of them are working properly. I thought that the product from Amazon might be having better quality than other sites,but now I think that I was wrong. I lost believe in Amazon. I have contacted the customer service and they told that service exicutive will inspect the phone and then only they can proceed. But I think this is not fair because the executive will reach to my house after two days and after inspection they will decide what to do. I need refund for this item, I will brought product of another company from somewhere else. Or I will file a case in consumer court for this issue against MI and Amazon India for cheating me.

The joy was, however, short lived. The charger failed to work. Went for return option but customer executive suggested a test via Blancco App. Done. Thereafter, he assigned a technician to visit my place and inspect the phone. Alas, the technician didn't turn up nor did he respond to call. In the meantime, phone frequently began to hang and misbehave. As of now I am cursing my fate. It is worst ever phone i have come across. Don't waste your money. You will repent the decision to buy this phone. Please take my advice seriously.

Fast charger doesn't come in the box.Neither comes a back case or screen protector or headphone. You have to buy all those separately.Camera quality is also not good.My suggestion is to spend 1-2k extra and go for other good phones.\\n\", '\\n  I would like to start with prosPros:1. After unboxing, the first feel and look is awesome. The aura x grip design on the back of the device is superb considering its price range which gives a premium feel while you are holding the device in your hands.2. The big 6.22 inch ips lcd display of resolution 720x1520. The viewing angles are good and comes with support of sunlight display which mean in outdoors one will not have a problem viewing this device. Due to its large screen content consuming is very good and the dot notch in the top middle of the screen does not annoy while watching videos or playing games. The display also comes with gorilla glass 5 protection which is very rare in this price segment and protects your device to some extent from scratches and drops.3. This device comes with p2i nano coating which means it can save the device from splashes of water to a certain extent. But do not dip it in water as it is not water resistant.4. This device comes with snapdragon 439 processor which is based on 12nm process. This chipset can go up to 2ghz and performs day to day task and gaming easily. Pubg lite and pubg mobile runs smoothly on this device. Pubg lite can go up to a maximum resolution of balanced at very high frame rates whereas pung mobile can go upto balanced with medium frame rates. Both games run smoothly without any lag or stutter.5. This device is powered by a 5000mah battery which gives a backup of upto 2 dys on average usage. But for heavy gamers and content viewers this device gives backup of upto a day on single charge. This device comes with 10ww charge and if you charge with 10w charger it takes around 2hr 30min but if you charge it by 18w charger it takes around 2hr.6. The camera on the back is 13+2 mp AI dual camera. The ai scene detection is good and fast. The backgroung blur during portrait mode is very good and the selfie camera is 8mp ai camera. This also support portrait mode but the blur could have been better. Both camera support 1080p recording at 30fps.7. Comes with face unlock and is pretty fast with proper lighting condition.Cons:1. The cameras could have been better.2. IR blaster is missing.3. Notification Led is missing.4. Fingerprint reader is missing.5. Both cameras struggles in low light conditions.6. Comes with miui with full of bloatwares and ads. But they can be disabled and and stopped.WARNING: For non chinese smartphone users if you buy this phone it will com with pre installed chinese apps banned by Indian government bu they will fix it with an ota update so not worry.My Opinion:After using this device I would recommend this device to buyers with budget under 10,000. Everything is good and the updates are also quick and timely. And no problem with the device.\\n', \"\\n  I am using 2gb/32gb variant(white). Using it since 16 days and have not found a problem yet... No hanging/lagging...i have downloaded games of 250-300 mb and played it... The result was fantastic and neither it hanged nor became hot while playing or charging... Speaker sound is pretty good and Camera quality is superb in good lighting conditions mainly during day time (outdoors), no one can say it's a 8k below phone by looking it's camera performance due to SD processor and battery backup is good too....Conclusion:- This phone is for people who are not game addict and those who love photography but are know in budget... The phone performance is lag free for day to day usage and most importantly uninstall or disable the preloaded apps if you don't use it.\\n\", \"\\n  Got my new redmi phone. Overall the phone is as per the features, but the quality of camera is not as per the advertisment, selfie camera is better than back camera, you can understand how the back camera is,  previously had Samsung phone with same mega pixel camera, it clicked so well, so here is the sincere request to all buyers, if looking for good camera, don't go for it,\\n\", \"\\n  I've been using Xiaomis product from Its Note 4 launch and was satisfied by its performance as well as its manufacturing in India as all the box contains information that it is MADE IN INDIA but this was the 1st time i bought this phone and it doesnt have that MADE IN INDIA logo and it's clearly written over there on the phone that it's MADE IN CHINA😠 I've not expected this from #Redmi_India that they cannot afford a budget segment phones manufacturing in their own country 🤧🤕\\n\", \"\\n  From a budget mobile battery backup and call quality are expected, call quality is pathetic, mic not clear, other party most of the times say that my audio is not clear. Further, earpiece volume is not loud and clear, I am not a power user, just some calls where it frustrated me and some youtube that's it, battery backup is good but what is the use of advancement in technology when it is not performing it's basic task, MI if listening provide good mic, speakers and earpiece for an overall good experience,\\n\", \"\\n  At the budget I didn't have any other choice. So bought this phone, totally a killer.Cons - signal reception not good and no fingerprint scanner.Pros - display and battery is awesome.I had issues with battery backup atfirst later on I turned off may things, which was automatically running in background. Now the battery is unbelievably good, mom is totally Happy with it.\\n\", '\\n  At this price range this is a good buy. The phone looks elegant and sleek.The camera is good outdoors in sunlight but in dark spaces it does not perform well. Again at this price it is worth it.The Ad ridden OS is a bit irritating but once the warranty is void one can install custom ROM.It is easy to handle and carry and the does not feel heavy even with the 5k battery.Did not face any overheating issues so far.I never play games so have nothing to comment on that front.Screen clarity is good and brightness in sunlight is also not an issue (I use dark mode)Overall a good buy but in a month or so you may get better models.\\n', '\\n  I\\'ve used many phones in this budget segment from renowned brands. I was always skeptical about Redmi/Xiaomi. It was hard to make a decision of buying this phone. But to be honest, I\\'m totally moved! Be it the display, be it looks, usage, it is totally a power package. The amazing thing is, you\\'re getting 5000 MAH battery in less than 8k ! Easily runs over 1.5 days with a full charge and average usage (multitasking, video streaming, browsing, social media). It also comes with 18W Fast Charging support. The display will blow your mind. Looks are quite good, could\\'ve been better. What is a drawback is it doesn\\'t have a Fingerprint Sensor, which is a must for phones in this budget! Camera quality is \"just okay\".Lastly, I\\'m using this device for the last 4-5 days, didn\\'t feel any lag though it comes with 2GB RAM, all credits to Redmi\\'s amazing optimisation.You can go for it without a single doubt in your mind if your budget is right.\\n', \"\\n  I don't like this.This is not a good product, I'm huge fan of redmi mobiles,i had also used the phone of this company and that was awesome but this is not good.I will just give only one 🌟 because the phone is not working properly and it is hanging\\n\", '\\n  The modem of this phone is very slow. It gives only half the actual speed. My other phone gives a speed of 90mbps on wifi whereas this phone give only 40 mbps on same network. Getting less than 1 mbps on LTE networks. Camera is below average.\\n', \"\\n  I use this phone more than 5 months I buy it on 4 march 2020 this phone is very very nice 😊👍 in my favor because I buy this phone for my father and it is very easy to use for him and but i brought this phone at range of 6999 rupee and also I see that phone is not lagging and not get heated 🔥  and camera of phone is also niceBut 1 mistake is that his AI screen lock 🔐 not ❌ get open in Instantely but overall this phone cames with 24 hour battery life if you check this phone in volt 📞 and sync and volt to use without power savingBut i see this phone price is geeted increase from 6999++ that shocking for this phone love for people and for peoplepeople and i also play PUBG in a starting months to check the phone performance which is ossom his all sensor almost Avery was working but i don't play now because it my father's mobile 🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯\\n\", \"\\n  After 1 week of usage:Nice battery backup (5000 mah)Nice display qualityGood soundNice camera quality in this budget.Big displayFace lock available however no fingerprint scanner.As said on the box it support wireless FM but it doesn't support wireless FM you need to connect your headphone for FM frequency.Support Fast charging which is very useful thing.Overall nice phone to buy.Thanks to Amazon for the exchange offer.\\n\", \"\\n  this is a good smartphone which comes with the USB Type C, 5000mah Battery, Good Vivid Screen, Gorilla Glass 5 Protection ,Good Camera Dual rear Camera (13mp+2mp), 8mnp selfie camera which u don't find under other smartphones of  this Budget segment  to be noted do not compare with other high budget smartphones camera ABOVE 10Kand in the last latest android 10 update Released in india & latest MIUI 12 is on its way in next month2GB variant performs well  Ram remains all the time under 60% usageThis is Good Buck Performs and Give features u cannot find in other smartphones , and other smartphones which are available i'm sure they are under preform as per the new smartphones of Redmi 9A, Redmi 9 they even also not has these features and comes with the DOWNGRADED REBRANDED PROCESSOR\\n\", '\\n  Nice phone in this price range except bit big to handle . I personally recommend not go for this screen size, as it is very difficult to handle or pick call using one hand (mostly during driving or doing some other work). it is quite slippery, so you land up with cover which makes it too big to keep it in pocket.\\n', '\\n  This review is for REDMI 8A DUAL 3GB RAM 32GB ROM(for use 21gb)Nice budget product. Large battery life last 1-2days. Camera is of average quality. Dual 4g standby. Charger given is of 10 watt. Type c port otg support. No fingerprint . Has face unlock. No ir blaster. Good sound and its quality. Sim tray is risky to use very delicate. Very less heating if you use it continuous\\n', '\\n  I expected a little more performance from a redmi phone. It has the typical problems of a 2 GB RAM phone. Really slow. I bought it for my mother. For her use it is just ok. For better performance, a minimum 4 GB RAM phone is needed, no matter which brand you select.\\n', '\\n  I bought this phone for my Father and generally preferred type c charging port which is provided by this 8000 rupee phone , although it has old processor but i must say optimization is good and also look of this is just awesome (not feel like cheap phone).Only draw back is miui which tons of ad but i find a solution to remove unnecessary apps which send anonymous notification.\\n', '\\n  It have sturdy Build Quality . corned with gorilla glass 5 and The display quality is Good.Pros :-Nice Build Quality 10/10Good Camera (both front and back)8/10Smooth performance 9/10Face unlock is pretty fast ( never expected that ) 10/10Good for Mid end gaming 8/10Battery is an absolute monster 10/10Nice display 8/10USB C + fast chasrging 10/10Cons  :-No Finger print censorMy Rating is 8.5/10\\n', \"\\n  Best mobile in this budget, Great battery backup...Just once when mobile received, Pls Go in to settings - Accessibility - OFF will be done.Not any problem shown till now, I purchased this mobile 3 Qty for me - my sister - mh wife.

You know the specs go for it . Don't expect higher performance on this budget . According to the budget Mi is delivering the best value .Now if you have some sentimental ego about Made In India products then my friend go and buy a Banana and pretend you are using a smartphone .Thank You.\\n\", '\\n  There is no finger print point,. Camera quality is very cheap & poor even 5000/- phone has better camera. If single camera is better, no need of such dual camera. XIAOMI just making fool. Screen is so so. Battery is good. Overall just 5 yrs back quality.\\n', '\\n  All good, as per the cost, eveey this is appropriate but it could have the fingerprint scanner. Processor and ram is okay for this price... No over heating issue. Good and smooth running. Can play Cod or pubg in medium settings. Battery is okay.. 5 watt charger in the box,, but it supports 18 watt fast chaeger, at this price, in box 5 watt charger is okay but if it could come, it shall be a best option because battery is big 5000 mah. No back cover. All redmk phns come with a back cover. But this is exceptional in this phone. All over 7 out of 10. Performance is excellent but accessories could have been upgraded in the box.\\n', \"\\n  Firstly 5 stars to Amazon for delivery this mobile phone with in 24 hours.Coming to this mobile phone, my first impressions are it is working good and I liked it's display.  Especially this low budget phone has Vowifi ( Wifi calling ) feature.  Camera is not good ( don't except much for this low price).  Still review under progress.\\n\", '\\n  Good phone and value for money, good at memory 3GB.. good response time, speed compared to other android phone with 3GB, may be its new 😊, if you have MI TV, screen mirroring is excellent on the full HD VIEW AND SOUND QUALITY.

You will Definatly love this Beautiful phone specialy blue one.\\n', \"\\n  The phone is good for usual browsing or low end games. You can play high end games like PUBG on low settings still with a small lag. One of cons is it doesn't have a fingerprint reader but has a 2D face unlock which works fine. Camera quality is okaish, what you expect from an under 10k smartphone. Best part is its 5000 mah battery, also supports 18 W fast charging but comes with 10 W charger. Overall a good budget phone.\\n\"], 'url': 'https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-Blue-Storage/dp/B07X4R63DF/ref=sr_1_14?dchild=1&fst=as%3Aoff&pf_rd_i=6308595031&pf_rd_m=A1K21FY43GMZF8&pf_rd_p=2c2b4d9e-f15e-4cf3-8e5c-acf68c668c41&pf_rd_r=80WR7NYVY11014AWK7F7&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_t=101&qid=1601263641&refinements=p_85%3A10440599031&rnid=10440598031&rps=1&s=electronics&sr=1-14', 'category': 'Mobile', 'destination_urls': ['https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A06729522LT96YINLKJ7L&qualifier=1602310037&id=5138464312160320&widgetName=sp_detail&url=%2Fdp%2FB07PQ7CXKG%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB07PQ7CXKG%26pd_rd_w%3DRjQl9%26pf_rd_p%3D1801b34c-8af9-42b5-8961-11f124edc99b%26pd_rd_wg%3D2utFL%26pf_rd_r%3DNTH4JQ8Y4VPCJFDK9XNE%26pd_rd_r%3D1973a73e-ceb9-465e-a103-2bade289b7b4', '/Exchange-Pick-up-Service-for-Mobiles/dp/B07P9BW77B/ref=bmx_1/261-8122208-6452309?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07P9BW77B&pd_rd_r=1973a73e-ceb9-465e-a103-2bade289b7b4&pd_rd_w=zouKQ&pd_rd_wg=2utFL&pf_rd_p=08abe11d-4ee5-46ca-8471-7bf18c53fc91&pf_rd_r=NTH4JQ8Y4VPCJFDK9XNE&psc=1&refRID=NTH4JQ8Y4VPCJFDK9XNE', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A047410210SADVJUV3MJT&qualifier=1602310037&id=5272261267968527&widgetName=sp_detail_thematic&url=%2Fdp%2FB07Q6GZXZK%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB07Q6GZXZK%26pd_rd_w%3D5HGy5%26pf_rd_p%3D719334a9-8cf4-4c2d-972b-46beedf42360%26pd_rd_wg%3D2utFL%26pf_rd_r%3DNTH4JQ8Y4VPCJFDK9XNE%26pd_rd_r%3D1973a73e-ceb9-465e-a103-2bade289b7b4', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A09426311PEC1EF9UNFRR&qualifier=1602310036&id=2244688137314738&widgetName=sp_detail2&url=%2Fdp%2FB07XVLMXYH%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1']}, {'_id': {'$oid': '5f815873aaa28c53dfe2b476'}, 'description': 'MMOBIEL Dock Connector Compatible with iPhone 6S 4.7 (White) Charging Port Flex incl 2X Screwdriver', 'price': '₹589', 'rating': '4.2 out of 5 stars', 'review_count': '207', 'reviews': [\"\\n  Very poor Quality, extremely slow charging, broken antenna, max speed on 4G is 20kbps. Yes 20kbps. Don't buy it please, expensive one but extremely cheap quality.\\n\", '\\n  I hv headphone stuck mode problem,i brought it but problem not resolved as product is already a damage item,after installing the same i found charging port is not working,i hv returned and got the refund.\\n', '\\n  My charger port become slack so I decided to replace the whole unit. It’s a little fiddly but it’s fairly easy. If you’ve never replaced one there is plenty of videos to help on YouTube. I had to replace this twice due to buying a dodgy one off another seller with a dodgy microphone. If your not too sure and need help just ask!\\n', '\\n  Great value for money, poor quality packaging and very small screwdrivers that are difficult to use with large hands.That being said, I ordered the white one for a space grey iPhone 6 and I can’t see where the colour is relevant.Be warned. NOT an easy part to install even with an engineering background. Very small screws which were extremely fiddly.Buy yourself a decent screwdriver / tool set and it will easier.Part installed in about 2 to 3 hours due to struggling with small screws but it has done the job and phone now charging as it should. Nob Problems to report with the phone jack that I read on other reviews, I use this daily and it’s a nice snug fit.\\n', '\\n  Worked perfectly and was very easy to install when following the instruction on the ifixit website. Fits very snug and is just as good quality as the origional that has to be replaced. Highly Reccomend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing replacement parts for their phone(s).\\n', '\\n  Wrong colour delivered should have been white but received grey. Seems to be adhesive residue in places, but has new adhesive on others. Also dirt in the corners of the lightning connector and 3.5 jack. I’d say it’s not a new part but someone has attempted to clean to pass off as new\\n', '\\n  Was slightly apprehensive about changing this part but it wasn’t that bad patience needed was well worth it phone is working again 😁\\n', '\\n  Perfect for what we needed, my phone now works fine, quick delivery too\\n', '\\n  Works like a charm.\\n', \"\\n  I bought this to replace my microphone, unfortunately it still doesn't work. The screwdrivers are tiny (luckily I had better ones from another kit). Be careful.\\n\", \"\\n  Described as new but mine has quite clearly been ripped out of an old iPhone as they've left all the black adhesive around the rim of a charge port, and on top of that the headphone jack is cracked ??!\\n\", '\\n  Screw drivers not good, I had to buy separately from another seller.\\n', '\\n  My item arrived broken and so is unusable. Delivery was fast however.\\n', '\\n  Shipment was really quick but anyway on my phone after installing headphone jack is not working.\\n', '\\n  Installed a day ago, it fits and works brilliantly well.\\n', '\\n  Great item works well and very affordable 👍\\n', '\\n  quality is so bad\\n', '\\n  Da bei meinem iPhone 6s die Ladebuchse kaputt ging und die Garantie vorbei war, musste ich das selbst in die Hände nehmen.Vorher hatte ich nie bei meinem iPhone irgendetwas ausgetauscht oder repariert aber da ich handwerklich mit solchen Sachen gut umgehen kann hatte ich keine Probleme damit. Wer allerdings sich damit nicht auskennt kann sich auf YT paar videos reinziehen dort wird alles ausführlich gezeigt und erklärt. Wer trotzdem bedenken hat sollte die Finger davon lassen. Bei mir hat alles gut geklappt und alles ist im grünen bereich\\n', '\\n  Wie schon einige Male erwähnt, sollte man sich das nur bestellen, wenn man sich den umbau zutraut. Seht euch am besten die YT Videos an. Hier noch paar Hinweise:- Achtet beim Artikel auf die Farbe (Weiß oder Schwarz), das hat wohl einen Einfluss- Drei Plastiken, die für eine stabile Funktion notwendig sind, sind NICHT dabei, die müsst ihr beim Ausbau der alten Dockconnectors drin lassen, bzw neu einbauen. Und zwar ist das die mit dem Mikro verklebte Gummischiene, die ganz unten bei der Innenseite am Handy anliegt. Über dem Mikro gibt es noch eine verschraubte Plastik, die übernommen werden muss, sonst geht das Mikro nicht richtig. Und schlussendlich sollte auch die Gummischiene rechts unten beim Lautsprecher übernommen werden. Diese ist ebenfalls verklebt und man sollte bei der Trennung Vorsichtig sein.Das Werkzeug ist nicht wirklich verwendbar, da zu klein, aber wer hin und wieder was beim iPhone bastelt, hat ja sonst genug von diesen Werkzeugen zu Hause. Ansonsten ein gutes und günstiges Produkt!\\n', '\\n  Hi,also das Ding ist schrott, da funtzt nix und passen tut auch nix.reine GeldverschwenungWiso kann man keine negativen Sterne vergeben ????????gruß\\n', '\\n  This charging port is also not great because you have to wiggle the cable to get it to charge. That’s the whole reason I replaced the old one.They aren’t easy to install and that’s not their fault. So it will be a pain to have to redo this part.\\n', '\\n  Item très bien mais malheureusement ce n’était pas la source de mon problème.  L’installation est très difficile, non pas à cause de la qualité de l’item mais parce cela demande du démontage de nombreuses minuscules vis et de décoller -coller les composantes.  Si vous ne pouvez pas changer la batterie de votre montre vous même... oubliez ça!\\n', '\\n  Ho acquistato questo componente.Tempi di consegna in linea con la qualità dei servizi offerti da Amazon...5 stelle!Ahimè, il ricambio risulta essere difettoso: il microfono ha un problema sia in chiamata vocale, sia nelle registrazioni tramite App Memo Vocale o Whatsapp; Jack audio funziona inserendo parzialmente il cavo aux; Discreto il connettore di ricarica.\\n', '\\n  Einbau hat gut funktioniert, die Anleitung war verständlich, an manchen Stellen war es nützlich, Videos hinzuzuziehen, um besser sehen zu können, was zu tun ist. Kann mein iPhone wieder benutzen. Allerdings funktioniert nun der Homebutton nicht mehr (TouchID dadurch auch nicht), was ich sehr schade finde, und das Mikrofon ist sehr schlecht, ich werde nicht verstanden. Habe jetzt also einen defekten iPod touch mit mobilen Daten.\\n', '\\n  La qualità del prodotto non è delle migliori anzi sono stato costretto a tagliare un pezzetto di plastica altrimenti il jack delle cuffie non entrava,Addirittura , controllando i microfoni, sembrava un pezzo già utilizzato\\n', \"\\n  I don't usually buy parts online unless I'm in dire need. But the 6S part worked flawlessly, mic worked great, charged properly and headphones work. I will continue to buy again, most sellers have issues but not this seller.\\n\", '\\n  Der Einbau war zwar fummelig, aber die Passform war gut und alles funktioniert, toll!\\n', '\\n  This microphone has static once and a while when talking.  Better than the original failed mic which would have the sound completely drop off but still very difficult to carry on a conversation with.\\n', '\\n  Schnelle Lieferung, beim Einbau gab es keine nennenswerten Probleme, passt sitzt und wackelt nicht, gerne wieder!Für den Einbau ist aber eine gewissen Übung notwendig\\n', '\\n  Good quality, would purchase again.\\n', '\\n  Perfetto e funziona tutto, attenzione alle guarnizioni originali da smontare dal vecchio per metterle sul ricambio\\n', '\\n  Ottimo ricambio facile da sostituire e perfetto\\n', '\\n  Funktioniert perfekt...Nichts zu meckern... Beim Einbau einfach Nerven bewahren, koordiniert arbeiten und Geduldig sein...\\n', '\\n  Bien\\n', '\\n  Easy to install.  Kit came with everything I needed to change the dock connector.  It works great.\\n', '\\n  ok funziona\\n', '\\n  Ottimo\\n', '\\n  Just received it . Cheap packaging . Part looked used . Still has glue on it around port . Thought i was buying a new part !Might try install it anyway since i need it ......\\n', '\\n  sehr zufrieden\\n', '\\n  This product worked pretty goodI just went to  YouTube and did a video tutorial on how to install\\n', '\\n  Lo devo provare iPhone 6s\\n', '\\n  totalmente compatible\\n', '\\n  charging port extra small, will not fit any lightning charging cable, not as described\\n', '\\n  uguale al originale\\n', '\\n  Todo ok\\n', '\\n  Non ho riscontrato nessun difetto compatibile al 100%\\n', '\\n  Tutto ok\\n', '\\n  Perfetto\\n', '\\n  Non funziona\\n', \"\\n  Le connecteur est de mauvaise qualité, la recharge est très lente, j'ai été obligé de racheter ce produit sur un autre site concurrent.\\n\", \"\\n  Je déconseille vivement ce produit. Le tournevis bleu pour dévisser les composants à l'intérieur du téléphone est trop grand on ne peut donc rien dévisser et donc on ne peut pas installer le produit\\n\", '\\n  Produit parfait\\n', '\\n  Ne fonctionne pas\\n', '\\n  Die Schraubendreher passen nicht so gut auf alle Schrauben im iPhone 6s. Manche Schrauben gingen gar nicht oder nur mit großer Mühe raus. Dabei rutscht man schnell mal ab mit den Schraubendrehern und das iPhone- Innere war dann so beschädigt, dass es nun gar nicht mehr brauchbar ist. Im Nachhinein hätte ich lieber 50€ für die Reparatur in einer Handywerkstatt bezahlt als mit Billig- Schraubendrehern herumzuhantieren....\\n', '\\n  Schnelle Lieferung...leider kein Hinweis das weiteres Werkzeug benötigt wird (Saugnapf zum Display anheben und kein Plastik Spachtel zum lösen und festmachen der Teile) zwei Schraubendreher waren dabei... Einbau ging dank YouTube Schritt für Schritt einfach...Ladebuchse funktioniert jetzt wieder... negativ ist leider, dass jetzt das Mikrofon nicht so funktioniert wie es sollte und ich nur noch über Headset telefonieren kann. Das nervt leider sehr, sodass ich jetzt nochmal das komplette Teil neu kaufen und einbauen muss.\\n', \"\\n  I bought this because a pin got stuck in one of the bottom microphones and destroyed it.  Took the phone all apart, took the old board out and put this one in and everything works just like it should! The only thing I would note is that the microphones come with a protective screen on them that needs removed or else its very muted.  (I had to tear it apart again because I didn't notice the first time.)\\n\", '\\n  Easy to installWorked like a charmCarrying around  portable chargers wears out charging port\\n', '\\n  broke my phone open, installed it, and nothing.  Ordered a competitors that was about $20 and it worked like a charm.  This item is literal garbage.\\n', '\\n  Great overall product!\\n', '\\n  Very cheaply made and had a broken connector out of the package. Save your money and upgrade to a higher quality connector.\\n', '\\n  Working well\\n', '\\n  Worst product u could get wrong part\\n', '\\n  Fast delivery & works great..\\n', \"\\n  Recommend very good lighting, a proper toolset and headmounted or table mounted magnification and watching many video's before you attempt this. Watch out for the small plastic grommet in the casing on the bottom left mic when you remove the old board as it can pop out. The single cable is very small and fragile so be careful on re-assembley of the phone and use  a jewellers loop to make sure the connector is correctly aligned before re-joining to board connector. Suggest unpacking this item by removing screw drivers and cutting open the plastic bag to remove the circuit - watch out for the mics if any try to stick to the bag.\\n\", '\\n  Good quality and works perfectly. You need to know what you’re doing regarding replacement but plenty of step by step video’s out there.\\n', '\\n  Okay thank\\n', '\\n  Excellent product.\\n', '\\n  Exactly what I ordered and needed\\n', '\\n  Ganz kurze produktinfoEs war in ein Wiederverschließbarem Plastiksack verpackt.Leider hat Amazon mir mit mehreren Ersatzteilen eine große Schachtel verpackt, wo sie evtl unten bei die Laschen herausfallen kann, aber das wird jetzt nicht auf diese Rezension berücksichtigt.Bei meinem alten Lightning Dock konnte ich nicht mehr wirklich laden und versuchte dies einmal zum tauschen.Es gibt hier leider keine Anleitung welche bauteile man rausschrauben muss, damit man überhaupt dort hinkommt wo man hin will.Beim auf bzw reinkleben dieses teiles ging wirklich problemlos wenn man zuerst den Klinkenstecker und die Ladebuchse festschraubt.Ganz Wichtig ist dabei nur die Schrauben nicht zu verwechseln!!!Schön wäre es auch wenn ein magnetische Unterlage dabeiwäre für die duzenten 1mm kurzen schraubenDie 2 Schraubendreher passten auch, obwohl ich die ein bisschen größer wünschen würde aber es ist für jeden eine eigene geschmackssache.In großen und ganzen passte dies zu 100% und würde ich sofort nachbestellen falls die kontakte wieder versagen. Es ist zwar einfach gestalltet aber bei Handys ist es immer wieder eine kleine fummlerei, das es eben seine Zeit benötigtEmpfehlung ist es auf jedenfall eine bevor wer 300€ für die Reparatur ausgibt\\n', '\\n  Der Dock Connector lässt sich super einbauen wurde aber leider defekt geschickt. Das Mikro ist scheinbar kaputt. Jetzt muss ich den Connector auf meine Kosten nochmal bestellen, da ich das Handy brauche und nicht erst das Teil ausbauen kann und auf Ersatz warten kann.Schade....\\n', \"\\n  OK, lo smontaggio dell'iphone è davvero complesso ma seguendo i tutorial su youtube si fa!Messo questo al posto dell'originale che non funzionava più il microfono: tutto ok e perfettamente funzionante!\\n\", '\\n  Item arrived on time and was perfect for what I needed! The only thing I would recommend is having some other tools at hand as well as their tools are very small and wore out eventually. Great buy! Worked right away! Great price!\\n', '\\n  El producto llego bastante rapido, 100% recomendable ya que el producto se fija a la descripcion, precio calidad muy buena.\\n', '\\n  Ottimo ricambio. Da tutti quanti che ho provato, questo è stato il migliore ( connettore principale con mollette metalliche, non come gli altri in plastica che dopo un po’ cedono).Venditore consigliatissimo. Arrivato puntuale !\\n', '\\n  Alles super, alles drin und passte alles\\n', '\\n  Ich hab diesen Produkt 2 mal gekauft für 2 unterschiedliche Iphone 6s und es funktioniert perfekt. Beim Einbau braucht man lediglich bisschen Geduld, da die Schrauben und Anschlüsse sehr klein sind.\\n', \"\\n  Easy to replace myself with the help of YouTube, of course. This unfortunately didn't solve my phone's problem, but the quality is great.\\n\", '\\n  Leider unbrauchbar. Die \"Kirmes-Schraubendreher\" sind ein Witz. Leider war auch die Ladebuchse ohne Funktion. 2 Stunden nerfiges herumgeschraube für nichts...\\n', '\\n  Todo perfecto, lo monté y funciona todo sin problemas! Llevo ya más de 1 mes y no ha dado ni un problema\\n', '\\n  Works great very thankful inclusion of the screw drivers as the ones i owned already were to big\\n'], 'url':

it dats all\\n', '\\n  Built-Boat bassheads  build quality is great but realme is better than themAudio- when i used boat earphone i was shocked feom its loudness if you want earphones with great volume then go with boatBass lover would love realme  budsService- my boat bassheads one side stop working when i contacted service center in a week it was replaceRealme service i have not any ideaOverall 4/5 to boat and 4/5 to realme alsoNow its your choice to choose the right oneI suggest better go with realme\\n', '\\n  Wire Quality is good but most important is sound quality is not so good...Right earpiece has low voice as we compare to left side earpiece\\n', '\\n  In One word, its Awesome. Its really have high bass.... this is sure that you get same high bass with *ubon prime* but there clarity is not maintained so well with bass but here vocal and every clarity amazingly maintained. HOWEVER YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT.\\n', '\\n  Realme buds 2 is very cheap quality earphone  and bass is not up to mark\\n', '\\n  This thing is too good for its price. You get really good bass, vocal are quite clear and even the build quality of this earphone is good fot its price and it has got a mic too. Talking about the mic i had no problems while using it during a call, not too good but gets the job done.\\n', \"\\n  I'm a diehard audiophile and have been using a lot of headphones. I dont usually buy expensive ones and mostly opt ones below 2k.Let me tell you, I fell in love with this buddy the very moment i put it in my ears. I was a JBL fanboy but lately there is a lot of quality issue with their products so I took a chance and bought this.In sub 1.5k range I can guarantee this is the best vfm product right now in the market.Pros:1. Build quality (is awesome)-Way better than JBL and Boat. Braided wire till splitter and earpiece ribbed wire is of good quality and feels durable.-You get magnetic tips too.-Mic clarity is good.-Buttons give a good feedback and feels premium.-Overall it gives premium feel. Didnt expect this much quality for Rs. 599.2. Sound QualityBass is just great, I mean GREAT and it does not muffle up mids and lows. Sounds more like JBL T110. Mid and low are also great. With proper equaliser setting, this guy will blow your audiophile brain.This is just soo good. Hope it will last long. Will update on durability after usage.# Update after 7 months of usage :Still going strong as the first day. No quality issues till now. Seems durable.\\n\", \"\\n  Its been the 3rd day and one side of the earphones isn't working.Pros:*Physically (external build) good*Very good microphone for recording*Bass is nice (but it is also the con of this earphone)*Aesthetically niceCons:*Cheap quality product.... You will feel this product very good by just looks but when start using it.. You will feel the inferior quality of the earphone.* output sound is not balanced.. There is only bass.Conclusion : better gift someone you don't like much but never use this for your own..\\n\", \"\\n  Don't go with negative reviews....all that is crap.. without any doubt go for it.... under 600₹ there is no other earphone who can give fight\\n\", \"\\n  I am giving 3 star just for good built quality.This is headphones has bass below than average headphones. I can compare it because i have used many brand earphone. With trust  in realme brand I was  expecting good bass for 600 bucks headphones but unfortunately it doesn't has. It is total balanced sound headphones with good built quality don't know how long it will go.If you are bass lover please don't go for it will definitely disappoint you.Comfort Fitting in ear 10/10👍Built quality 9/10👍Cable quality 9/10👍Loudness 8/10Bass 4/10👈For movies, podcast and lecture...👍For music....👎Hope this will be helpful....😊\\n\", '\\n  Just got my buds 2 delivered. It seems like volume buttons are not working. When I press volume up or down buttons it changes song track to next or previous. The device I am using us redmi K20 pro. Is anyone facing this issue? Do let me know. For previos and next track change they have provided triple click and double click in the main button but it seems volume buttons are changing the tracks. While watching videos I cant increase or decrease volume.\\n', '\\n  Best headphone at this price point\\n', '\\n  I have been using it from yesterday. I am happy with this product. Realme is doing a good job in competition with Xiaomi. Let`s check pros and cons :Pros :1. It is true that it has good bass.2. The cable is lengthy.3. The overall sound is great.Cons :1. The wire is very thin. Pressure may break it.2. The point of 3.5mm jack and the wire is weak. Keeping in a pocket may break the cable from the jack.If you want good bass and sound quality then go for it. But if you are thinking to ride in cycle or bike riding it then you should go for wireless mi neckband or realme buds wireless.\\n', '\\n  If i compare this product yo boat basshead 225, buds 2 is average, no loudness, no deep bass just average.Go with bassheads 225 for superior bass metal outer  loud sound and value for money.\\n', \"\\n  Don't buy these they will send realme buds 1.......It is a total waste of money ..sound quality is worst at its point range....Amazon is taking advantage since there is very less difference in appearance so they are giving realme buds 1 in package and at price of realme buds 2...this is a total fraud case by Amazon and realme\\n\", '\\n  Valum button not working\\n', '\\n  build quality is awesome but sound quality not that great ok ok.but value of money product feel like premium earphone.\\n', \"\\n  Build quality is good. It's braided & tangle free. But what about the sound quality?Overall sound quality is fine. Sound bit off if you're switching from a high quality/end earphones but you can tune these with an equalizer to make these buds 2 sound better.Highs are good. Mids are fine. Lows are smooth & okay but Mid lows kinda cracks/distorts at max volume.Pubg experience is good in PC too. You can clearly hear your surroundings. The gunshots the plane sounds also the footsteps above you or lower you.Cons are:Lower mids distorts on max volume.Equalizer is must if you wanna hear some nicely balanced sound.UPDATE:After few more days these buds started distorting the highs too much... Distortion is noticeably present in highs and mid lows. So replaced these. Not worth the price better to go with Sennheiser or Skullcandy.\\n\", \"\\n  Absolutely loved it, my first preference was always OnePlus in this rang after which MI earphones....but I'm telling you these are amazing earphones... Now I feel he would give tight competition to rest who thinks they have taken over market. Guys blindly buy them, if you feel I'm wrong I'll buy them from you....this was my review after 1 week.After using one month right side bud is not working and no Volume is coming out of it. I need a replacement\\n\", \"\\n  Crystal clear sound with awesome bass. Good quality tangled free cable, value for money too. But one thing nobody is going to tell you i.e it fully support only Realme phones only. + - or mic may or may not be work with different devices. It fully support only Realme phones. I have checked in 6-7, different devices and conclusion is that vol up button opens Google assistant, in some phone play next track. It's means that different devices performed different activities. I have also searched online for this solution but answers says it's a goggle software bugs, hope they will find solutions in future. Whatever the reason make clear it will work all functions if your phone luckily support it. No issues with sound quality or others,if you are happy with manually vol + - or changing the track then go for it. Realme users must buy product without any doubts all functions work fully because both will be Realme brands and support each other. Thank you\\n\", \"\\n  A very detailed review if you are confused about this product's quality🤔🤔  The earphones from realme are just too good in this case.... Here goesThe Pros.😃1. The earphones mainly are mainly outstanding in this price range. None other earphones provide such a good bass and sound quality at such a price. Must say the BASS IS REAAAAL GOOOOOD!!! The sound clarity is really great and crisp clear and no disturbance at all at high volumes.2.The earphones and wire junction is provided with a rubber clip kind of which gives it durability from wear and tear.3. The magnetic rear ends of earphones are pretty strong and stick on their own when they are close enough and don't fiddle with the sound quality as they are passive magnets.4. The earphones connecting wire is round and textured such that it is tangle free.5. The buttons are pretty clicky and does a good job and are just comparable to the basic ones.6. The remaining wire is a braided one with which i am very impressed as none other earphones come braided at such a price...once again.7. The length of the wire is decent and wire manager also does a pretty good job.8. The realme branding on the earphones and the yellow-black dual colour give it a premium look.9. They arent much of a problem when it comes to comfort as they do pretty well in that area.Here Goes...The Cons.😕1. The connector given is not an angled one whereas other earphones nowadays come with an angled one.2. The volume buttons provided are a lityle difficult to handle without looking at them as they plus and minus are not protruding.3. I dont find a real use of the wire manager as it is not really required in earphones.Overall, a very strong move by realme with the earphones with outstanding performance of the earphones.If you are looking for a budget earphones and amazing sound quality just go for it.As for amazon, tgey did a good job in packaging and delivery.👍So, this is it about the review...And if you find this helpful, hit that helpful button.👍👍👍👍Thank you\\U0001f91f✌\\n\", '\\n  Light Ear phones, Nice fit ,Premium build quality, Bang for buck,Nice clarity and decent Bass\\n', '\\n  This is a good earphone from real me.great design Bass is excellent and great quality.large size bud is greater bass. if you have any Realme mobile this would be best buy becoz of excellent real sound technology..\\n', '\\n  -> Has a braided cable-> Awesome sound quality\\n', \"\\n  If you want the best headphones below Rs. 1000, you got 3 best options. One is Sennheiser cx180 which has got exceptional sound quality but comes without mic and also with thin wires. Next is JBL c100si with next best sound quality and the best with mic. This too has average build quality. Here comes the realme buds 2 with exceptional build quality but with a sound quality little worse than JBL c100si and cx180 but still above average than most headphones of this price range. The cables is thick and comes is braided until it splits foreach warm. The magmets are useful in minimising tangles. The sound is quite enjoyable and gets quite loud to the point which above 70% volume the bass is so boomy and music gets muffled and echoey. In normal volume the music is quite clear.. infact 70% volume of this headphones is equivalent to 100% in other headphones. I don't get why they made it so loud to the point the audio so much worse for any good listening experience.\\n\", \"\\n  I had high expectations from realme.Really disappointed. After reading positive  reviews I bought this.• It was like they tuned the earphones to create a  surround sound like effect by compromising  sound quality .•Vocals are very distorted, the balancing  of sound is not tuned properly.•they are promoting  this earphones  for bass but trust me the bass isn't  decent at all.•I tried to tweak sound using two devices using dolby atmos equalizer  but no use .one thing is good that is the quality of wire which seems to look durable which is useless without sound quality.I returned  this product.\\n\", \"\\n  Got fooled by all the reviews on YouTube and here.The bass is lil bit boosted and loudness is bit higher...the clarity and mid tones are very worst, there's bit treble.Build quality seems good and durable, volume and call function keys works as expected. Noise cancellation is ok.But overall disappointed, my JBL Infinity 100 which i bought few months back does a good job.Got to admit that Sennheiser is the Boss, nothing beats cx180 / 213 price below 1000. Should have bought Sennheiser instead of this crap.\\n\", '\\n  Best earphone under 600Quality is too good braided cableNice bass sturdy design tangle freeAll are good go for it without any dought\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality good specialy bass lover earphone better than mi basic/boat100/JBL/Vivo ...one thing would be more better if cable length little big it's cable length 1mtr and other earphone like mi cable length 1.25mtr ..If you are bass lover go for it ... sound quality super and call voice clearty good ..overall best earphone under 600\\n\", '\\n  Comfortable\\n', '\\n  Completely dissatisfied lot of research done to buy good quality earphones after that I chooses realme 2 as per YouTube reviews but completely dissatisfied looks cheap side found in some case not all time ther no no chance to play pubg with these earphone you cannot hear other person  sound Clearly because of low frequency dominating(bass) total dissatisfied\\n', '\\n  Realme buds 2 is actually a beast!, I think the best earphone in the price range of 600₹. Sound quality is very impressive bass and treble is actually good not high and low perfect. I used this for playing PUBG, sound is very impressive you can easily predict where is your enemey coming from. I will suggest you to buy and use this for once if you confused which earphone should I buy.\\n', \"\\n  People who said the bass is not great either don't know what they are talking about or have a crappy phone. This is my day 1 review based on first experience. Sound quality is good. Snug fit in the ear (default buds). Seems very comfortable. I barely feel there are earphones in my ears. At 20% volume, I am unable to hear the surroundings, The sound is that high. The green color earphones look so good. The lower section is braided to allow tangle free handling. There is a cable organizer as a bonus addition. Magnetic tops to give additional flexibility to clip them together. What else people expect St this price, I fail to understand. Go and get it if you are looking for a good comfortable stylish earphones. It is a no brainer.Note: I use a skull candy crushers over the ear headphones, a pair of harp  divine 3 truly wireless earbuds and an avid music listener, so I believe I have a decent experience with earphones.\\n\", '\\n  I went for these earphones after watching the review from Geekyranjit, (a shout-out to him for a helpful review). These earphones are pretty good and although the specs say about a 11.2 mm driver, the experience is not that different from a JBL 9mm or for that matter Mi 9mm earphones.Mids (Vocals) - 7/10Lows (Bass) - 9/10Highs (Trebel) - 9/10Mic (Clarity) - 9/10Cons - I think its personal but these are not good for leisure time, you lying down on the pillow on your sides, its discomforting. Prolonged use is discomforting for the right ear. Then again these can be personal, you might not even have a problem.Verdict - Definitely a good buy for sub 600 earphones.\\n', \"\\n  It's been like 15 days and the unbraided part of the wire has come out, just in time for the return window to get over. I don't even want to get into the details of the sound quality and others coz what's the point if the wire just comes out like that even if you hardly used it. I'm not even a heavy user. This earpiece is worth 200 to 300. Not a penny more than that. I feel cheated coz the return window has closed. Realme should have braided the whole thing. I don't understand why they left the crucial part of it and made it become a badly designed product.\\n\", '\\n  Low budget mobile not worth this head set for eg 5k - 20k mobile not worth. I have samsung s7 edge realme buds 2 head set awesome perfect bass , clarity. but low end mobile total wasted this head set do not buy this head for low budget mobile. For eg i have another 14k levono mobile  connect total wasted 60% volumes too much louds not bass , no clarity, head pain. actually not balance this head set.Best buy dynamics range headset for sennheiser is best.\\n', '\\n  Please read this, then buy this earphones.Pros ;Sound Quality :Really sound quality is too good, but if you listen with more than 80% volume, you may see some distortion.Bass Quality :Bass is also good, it\\'s a worthful buy for bass lovers.Noise Cancellation:It is good, but not that much to tellBuild:Overall build is good, it is comfortable too, cables are also good and tangle free.Cons ;Call Quality :I will always speak too many phn calls.

The product quality is very good.\\n', '\\n  i wont recommend this piece of garbage, You better return this earphones. i have used about every earphone in the range of 500 to 2000 n these are the worst in all of them. I bought this after watching many reviews n thought maybe this is a gud product and it was in case od build quality but i came to notice where the compromises were made to cut the cost. The speaker inside the earphones are cheap like Chinese 1 n when pared with 11.5mm drivers they can give you a headache in half an our or more depending on ur sound level. I could feel my ear bleed. Tho bass was decent buth when the sound is crap what can you do with base n also they dont work properly in laptop or any pc (mic wont work). I suggest you better get a JBL or sony even boat rockers but not this.\\n', \"\\n  This is decent ear phone at this price. I wish to see its warranty period extension as it has only 6 months of warranty. It should be for 1 year as all the ear phones companies are doing same thing that leaves the ear phone's one side working only. This looks good using real me for the first time lets hope i do not face the same issue with this. Used sony, boat, local.. Same issue .. One ear peice stopped working after 3-4 months.. Thats not good. As i hear alot about this product on youtube bought ... Lets hope for the best.\\n\", '\\n  Metal mess on the eartip is suprb..but feels uncomfortable as it is big...i feel pain when lying on bed in side position..bass is really high which causes smashing other tones specially trable and instruments..pubg playing on it is hectic..not pleasing,mic is good 3 button layout is nice,no support for the wire which is coming out of the earplug..it is annoying..when ever u take out earbuds u have to find the earbuds itself,feels unsafe for sudden taking out\\n', \"\\n  This is my first time purchase of realmeI will say what i like about this earphone after a week useThe earphone sound bass clarity and noise cancellation is good but not like boat it has better noise cancellation slightly better bass, it has good sound, bass quality is good at high volume, the cable are tangle free which is more convenient to carry in pockets, the magnetic is added plus which makes the cable head detangling, there is no clip for attach in shirt rather it has rubber type material it's i dnt like sometimes annoying, the yellow colour very catchy design in this earphone perfect for black lovers(me😍) the volume up and down works fine (with mobile only) voice quality good and precise, one thing i dnt like is the left earphone makes my ear paining after few minutes of use i feel uncomfortable maybe it's for me if anyone has same issue do mention in comments, overall i love this earphone I'm not paid reviewer seriously it's good buy you won't regret...\\n\", \"\\n  Excellent earphones if you are a music lover. But the good part kinda stops there.I bought these after extensive research on earphones. This was ranked among the best.Although there is no doubt about the quality here are some drawbacks* The biggest drawback is this one is that it doesn't work properly on my laptop. Not sure if this was intended, but all my previous earphones worked (at least for listening). It works most of the time for watching movies but doesn't work for video/audio calls on laptop. Everybody complained additional noise through it.* The 2.5mm Jack is not angled at 90 degrees. This configuration is not perfect when you keep your phone in your pocket with the earphones plugged in.* Even though they mention it as take free, it is not exactly. But once tangled it is easy to free then* No clip given with it so it is not ideal for sports/runningHere are the positives* Good sound quality* Balanced bass* Good build quality* Magnetic buds good idea*\\n\", \"\\n  It is indeed better than most of the other expensive options, I prefer balanced sound over just bass or vocal. It's not just about bass it's about tuning how accurate and pleasant it sounds and complement the vocal, bass is associated feature not primary. Vocal is better than other options because it vocals are little louder but sound quality didn't satisfied me though better than most even better or equal to some of the expensive options. Sound must be loud and clear which majority of the earphones lack. Their are just few options available which have good sound quality but their build quality is bad won't last long. So overall it is a great choice. Thank you...\\n\", \"\\n  Okay after researching and watching reviews on YT about this earphones, can say this is the most overrated product. My experience: As I'm using with Samsung A50 with Dolby Atmos on, it really gives good output(Mobile ki tareef kar rha hu yaha) but earphones are not giving what they are ment to be! On average bass, slightly over sharped music, built quality is what you ll get on point only! But what you can expect in 599? On average product with tons of high end influenced add. 3.5 overall (3.5/5)\\n\", '\\n  Cos ->vocals are not clear because of highly distorted bass (worst bass) that they are offering...loudness is too much but there is no use of it...no L-shape connector...Pro ->build quality is excellent specially for rough user...adjustable strap is useful...i have returned my earphone today because sound quality no up to the mark...\\n', '\\n  Using it with lg v40 and lg v20.  Have lg quadbeat and b&o h3 earphones. Needed daily driver for rough use, the earlier earphones are fragile and dont like to use them roughly.So after searching for a while i stumbled upon these. My main criteria was budget earphones. Sony and sen heisser have almost doubled their prices on entry level products. Have owned them in the past but didnt feel worth purchasing at the current rate.Was very skeptical about this purchase, but am impressed so far with the sound and overall build quality. Everything works.Here are my cents :1. Bass - 3.5 of 5. It has strong booming bass. Not as punchy. Frequency response is bit stronger on 80hz - 100hz range.2. Mids - 3 of 5. Again these are bass heavy. So mids are slightly recessed. But even some hugh end ones suffer from this, and at this budget cant complain.3. High - Slightly better than mids.Cable quality and packaging is good. Especially at this price point.Looks great too. Wasnt expecting the premium look that it offers.All in all, i would say this is the best option at this price range atm.\\n', \"\\n  Completely blown away and surprised. I've used first iteration of Realme Buds - JBL - Boat. None comes nowhere near this.It's not just the bass, but the sound quality it produces is awesome.Durable - will last for a year easily.Best bang for buck.You can stop your quest finding the right one in Budget. Go for this !\\n\", '\\n  Everything is okay except the 3 button remoteEverytime I press volume up button, it activates Google assistantFound no way to fixThinking to return it(tried in Motorola One Power)\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality and all is great but it doesn't lasts even it's warranty period. I bought the same twice for me and the wireless version too for me and my sister and all of them stopped working,2 in 2 months,the other in 4 months. So, i bought 3 earphones from realme online and none of them lasted even 4 months. You can't even contact amazon anyhow these days, I don't know how to claim warranty on these products. Please don't buy this product from amazon or any other online store. You can get these from your local stores.\\n\", '\\n  I seen a lot of skeptical reviews abt it , qm using redmi note 5 pro !! As you know its better to personally go and buy ear phones out from store so that u can try it beforr buying , cos eventjough it has 3.5mm jack , some times it doesnt works that well wen u consider those 5 star reviews !!Now talking abt my experience , well in one word , it  was amazing ,  tue quality is great ! You dont even feel that u r wearing a headset.. , super light weight...  Volume buttons works like they r supposed to.. microphone is superb..  and the bass... Talking abt it.. hmm i dont know.. i mean u have to feel it... I mean i have used ant audio.. boult audio.. boat audio.. out of all these..  realme 2 buds..  goes unbeatable.  Both in quality comfort and performance..  that too on budget !!! It works well in redmi note 5 pro !!!\\n', \"\\n  I'd give it a 4 star rating for a few small nitpicks:1. The 3 button remote is a fantastic feature for this price point but I'd appreciate if it was on the left side or at the junction instead of on the right side. Getting used to this is painful. Also the center button should have been bulged but its recessed in these and feels odd - i had to search for it everytime.2. Bass quality is comparable to Boat BassHeads 225 but this one fits better thanks to the angled design. The fit is snug and the passive noise isolation due to this sealing is good. The buds do not induce pain over long hour usage.3. I feel the cable is 'heavier' and sometimes feel a pull.4. Adding magnets to keep the buds attached is a nice touch. No functional use but does help while storing the buds.Overall, a good buy for 499. Not more than that.\\n\", \"\\n  Initially i like this earphone but let's see how long it will survive.I like jbl c100si\\n\", \"\\n  Both This RealMe Buds 2 Wired Earphones and The Blaupunkt EM10 are Literally The ONLY 2 earphones That LEAD The Budget Segment WITH TITLE OF BEST IN AUDIO QUALITY and Even Build Quality Really Good.The Magnetic Feature makes it Really Handy to just Snap Them together around your neck and the Rubber Belt Keeps the Excess Wire in Check which is a Handy Feature.Tip: Use the Rubber belt through your shirt button loop to keep excess wire hidden in the Shirt T-shirt or To Your Belt Loop so You DON'T HAVE EXCESS WIRE getting Caught somewhere and Damaged.Absolutely Brilliant Sound on par with the EM10 Blaupunkt! They match each other so don't be upset whichever you buy they're both the Best! The only thing I like about EM10 over this is the ear piece shape being more lightweight and comfortable though this the Buds 2 are manageable.\\n\", '\\n  Not working properly on Android phone\\n', '\\n  Since i have used earphone ranging from 3000 to 30rs , i have enough experience in sound and audio, and genuinely speaking these look good pros and cons are-Pros.1. braided and nice design2. Mic is of good quality3. Has volume controls too4. Bass is ample.Cons.1. Sound quality not good overall2. High frequencies are distorted.3.bud design is bulky.\\n', \"\\n  Sound is quite good, but the mic quality isn't better, mic stopped working within 5 days of using. I request for return of the product let's see what happens.\\n\", \"\\n  I don't see many talking about this but there is a static noise at low volume. I didn't notice it at first but then I was watching a movie and when the volume of the movie went down, I heard a faint static noise. I ignored it at first but it was prominent afterwards. I issued a replacement request. Let's see if the replaced product has the same issue. Btw the sound quality and bass quality are quite nice. The physical quality of the earphone also seems pretty durable.Edit: I got them replaced but the problem is still there. You won't notice it if you just listen to music which has nothing else but beat drops but if you care about the melody the static noise is going to bother you very much. It's funny how the earphone holds up at high volume but gives up at low volume while most of the time with other brands it's the other way around. Anyway, I've decided to return them and buy something else.\\n\", \"\\n  Working great with my Samsung Galaxy M30s which didn't come with it's own headphone/earphone. Ordered it a long time back. The length of wire (from ears to where both wires are become one) is equal, thus it doesn't give a tacky look in metro/office.  Mic wires great. Sound quality is great. In fact, I was pleasantly suprised cause I had started to believe only earphones of the parent company (same company as that of the phone) work well with a mobile.I have tried JBL, skull candy earphones in the past ( the most affordable ones which come at the top of amazon search page when you type earphones). They are pathetic. I gave them to my family members.My go to choice so far was Sony White headphone which you get from 490 or 599 maybe (depends on the sale price then). I found these Realme headphones better than Sony in Bass. With Sony, even at the max volume , I would feel the need to play it louder. No such issue with this Realme earphone as the music/bass thirst is satisfied greatly at a few levels below the max volume itself.As far as official ON VIDEO CALL look is concerned, I suggest you go with typical white earphones as green although fancy, doesn't look that well. I am thinking of buying white Sony headphones yet again just for video calls. Also, with these realms earphones , you have to constantly separate left and right wire while on calls. Cause they come together and cup your face. Sony headphones don't do that(The upper part is longer there).If the look and green color specifically doesn't matter to you on webinars, totally go for it as the music quality won't disappoint you.Storing these realme earphones is easy. It doesn't tangle much. It's because bottom part (below the connector) has fabric like feel. The upper part is rubbery,  only this part tangles.

I have used boat, Boult, ANT, Sennheiser and lately beyerdynamic earphones. Here are some objective observations after burning in the earphones for 6 hrs with pink noise.1. Low frequency (Bass): Excellent. Better than Boat bassheads 225. Better means the way it's presented to your ears.2. Mid frequency (midtones): vocals sound crisp and are not muffled by bass.3. High frequency (treble): well presented, but compared to other frequencies, a bit less sharp.4. Soundstage: as good as beyerdynamic beat ByrdOverall the sound is rather bass tilted but crisp and loud. It gives a pleasant feeling when you put these on and listen to, say, guitars and drums (country songs) or Bollywood rewind songs recreated by Strumm.Call quality is good and there is no problem with the mic.\\n\", '\\n  I am really disappointed with these earphones. I got the defective one and it seems like that the balance of buds is very poor and one of the buds is sounding more and other one less.......so this is horrible for 600I suggest that you should better go for boat bassheads 225 which has premium build quality and performance is also far better than this\\n', '\\n  i have bought this earphone last year November, its stopped working after 7 month of medium use.mic is not working and wire causing some trouble during connection. product quality is worst better go for other branded earphone and pay extra 100-200 inr would not recommended to anyone\\n', '\\n  I have attached pictures of all notable features of Buds 2 with this review. Realme has surprisingly revamped the original pair of Buds and have done a great job with the new Buds 2.There is something known as a soundstage present in high-end audio products which helps you to understand where the sound is coming from-left, right, centre, behind, front. The Buds 2 boasts a decent soundstage which is generally not put in by manufacturers in low-end audio products.Sound clarity is very decent but not the clearest because of the presence of hard-hitting and punchy bass. Bass from the big 11.2mm drivers is accurate and the earphones have bass vents on the sides. See, when audio devices are focussed on bass the highs and mids are automatically compromised irrespective of the hardware packed into them because of the science behind sound. Nonetheless Realme has done a great job in making these earphones sound comparatively cleaner and sharp.The microphone has a condensor which filters noise so that voice is captured cleanly and the remote control is tactile and has a yellow accent running on the sides. Eye to detail.The cables are sturdy and generous-the lower half is backed by braided knitting while the upper half is textured rubber.Why would you buy this pair of earphones from Realme?The sound is clean, there is a soundstage present, bass is sharp and feelable, build quality is sturdy, pricing is decent for the hardware packed in it.Go for the black ones they look premium.\\n', '\\n  Im a really big audiophile and I rarely buy cheap earbuds because my past experience has always been terrible, but for the first time a sub ₹1000 earbud has blown my mind! I was surprised when I first plugged them in and listened to some hip hop and edm and the bass response of these buds was mind blowing, you can really feel the thumpiness of the bass even without an EQ. The noise cancellation was far superior that most of my other expensive earbuds. Sometimes i feel like the bass is a bit too much that the vocals of the song start to get unclear but it only happened with a few songs when my EQ was on. The cable is braided and ive never seen them getting tangled easily, i feel like the length of the cable is a bit too much, im 6’2 and still they reach till my thighs. Just go for it, Im sure you wont be disappointed, realme knows how much we indians love bass and have launched a product that is perfect for our region. Great job realme.\\n', '\\n  The headphone may advertise 11mm drivers and all that stuff but the sound quality is not good. The bass is definitely boosted but not in a good way. The treble sound are not clear and feels like the earphone cannot handle the audio. This not not recommended earphone for listening to songs. Keeping it because of the braided cables. Also found out that the magnetic tips not no practical use except for hanging it from your refrigerator or iron cupboard which is not really required.\\n', \"\\n  I ordered Sony XB55A before this one and had to return them as I found them quite bulky. Coming to these earphones, there are so many things to like about them. For the price of almost 1/3rd of the Sony ones, these do ample of things right.1) The cable is braided. These earphones tend to get damaged near the tail end only and a huge relief.2) Apart from having a button to play/pause the music, it has volume up and down button as well (which was not there in the Sony ones).3) Earbuds attach magnetically. So, if you want to take a break in between when you are listening to some music or when someone calls your name and you have to remove the earbuds, you can attach them at the back of your neck magnetically.4) It has a cable manager as well. Since it provides no case/pouch within the box, hence an appreciable decision.5) Finally, addressing the elephant in the room, how's the sound? Well, honestly quite good. I use them with Redmi K20 pro and after tweaking some settings, I was really content with the sound signature. The bass is not that thumpy, I agree but it's adequate.Verdict: In the tech world, seldom it happens that you find the PERFECT gadget/item. There is always some room for improvement. But I'm glad to say this is one of those items. Sound quality, build quality, features, pricing, everything is almost perfect. I wear them almost 2-3 hours a day and have absolutely no issue. JUST GO FOR THEM.PS: Green one looks quite neat.\\n\", \"\\n  I was Using mi basic earphones earlier and these are much better than them, better looking and also better in sound,I am also using realme wireless earphones priced 1800 so I thought to go with realme again and it's quite goodHere's few pros and consPros.1 Treble Is 👌👌2.Mic is really good, didn't faced issue even while I was speaking slow3.theres a coating of cloth type material on wires so I think it's gonna last really long4.magnet to connect both earphones5.a orange strip to keep wires organisedCons.1. There's button and those button have shortcuts like double press to next etc. But Triple press isn't working for me it's supposed to go back to previous song2.theres magnet to connect both earphones but music keeps playing even after connecting themIts good but in wireless earphones music stops so I was expecting same from them too but they didn't stop / pause music3. Well bass is not that bad but i didn't liked it that much, treble seems good but bass isn't satisfying me, disappointed a little bitNo other cons, go ahead and buy theseBetter than almost every other wired earphones in this price rangeBut Don't Buy If You Are a pure bass lover, u will regret believe meTried many settings with viper4fx and dobly atmosDevice is rooted so pushed the voice and bass to its edge and it showed that its not that goodBass lover avoid this\\n\", \"\\n  To clear all your doubts whether you should purchase these or not read the following:I have been using Sony earphones for the past 9 years. I have used almost all of their models in the range of 2000 to 7000.Next thing is I prefer wired earphones over bluetooth ones.Now, I ordered these earphones as a buffer. Now when I plugged these earphones and listened to the sound quality I was quite impressed.Bass: I would say they have a really good amount of bass. The bass doesn't hurt your ears and you really feel the bass. Compared to my Sony's there just really close to them.Mid tones And High Frequencies: These sound good and are actually crisp. I don't know why other people are saying that the Mid tones and the High tones are not that great. But yeah as these are bass boosted you might feel that High Tones are a bit suppressed if you compare them to my Sony's which are >₹3000. The high tones are like when you play songs on speaker with high treble and turn the bass up as well.+ Sony wired earphones do not have dedicated Volume Up and Down Buttons.And considering the price they are a sure GoGo.Build Quality is great, no angled jack was a bummer I guess for me.For all those audiophiles like me who are on a budget, if you can buy Sony's I'd recommend the one's >₹2000 or else buy these.\\n\", \"\\n  Realme earbuds 2 is much better than realme earbuds 1 Because it gets much better sound quality and base.*Build Quality*Build quality of this earphone is really nice its wire is coated with fibre which means it becomes more durable. But only half wire is coated with fabric note the above area.*Colour*It comes with three types of colour black, green and orange. I have bought green color ear phones but it does not look good at all. So I suggest you to buy black one.*Inbox*You will get one earphones and two pairs of extra hair cups. one pair is large and another pair is small. So if you doesn't feel comfortable with medium size you can replace it as you want and feel comfortable.*My opinion*I really love this earphones and its sound quality also realme added some base and increased audio which makes it better than realme earphone 1.Sound quality is amazing you should definitely purchase this but don't buy green Orange version because black one is is better then all.I have provided some pics so you should also check them out to know how this earphones actually looks like.\\n\", \"\\n  Yeah, very impressed.I am liking these more and more with each passing day. No gold plating on the jack, no angular jack but damn these earphones sound so good!On realme devices, please use the real sound technology with the default music app. I am surprised by the output. Bass is at par with my JBLs and better than the Focal Sense. CX180 sounds better, costs more, has no mic so let me leave that aside.Noise cancellation is okayish, in ear type so it blocks some noise. At full volume, sound leaks outside - something very common even with some of the higher range headphones. Braided cables are almost tangle free but the magnetic ear buds may behave like a knot. Mic is good, volume controls work nicely. Blindly go for it if you have 1000rs budget and need something with mic. I love the JBLs too and would've placed them higher but they come with really soft wires that break within a year if you are someone like me who uses headphones a lot. These won't disappoint :)\\n\", \"\\n  With a lot of different options in the marker at the price range 500-600 I was first confused which one to buy but I chose these earphones to buy as these were the latest model earphones. And I was really surprised at the quality at the price (Rs550) I recieved. The wire is braided upto the mic and has options to play/pause music, volume control and call receive and call end. They have good noise cancellation but considering they are in ear headphones so that is to be expected obviously. The treble is good, bass is a little bit high but it doesn't throw the sound off like in some other headphones, mids can be heard easily but in complex tones they kind of fade out loose their individuality but a normal user won't notice this mid fade up unless you are pro music creater and using these earphones for mixing. I've been using these for like a month now as my on the spot go to portable earphones and I'm really not disappointed with the price I paid for these, their sound quality is better than any MI or other headphones in the market upto the price range of  atleast Rs 600 at the time of writing(13 oct 2019). With a little V shape pattern of equalizer you can easily get the best quality music these earphones can offer. If you can get these upto Rs600 I would say they are worth buying\\n\", \"\\n  Best build quality in the budget segment under Rs 1500. Bass is quite punchy in comparison to other earphones in this segment. The magnets in the ear buds and the cable organiser r pretty useful and allow easy management of the wires and storage of the earphones. The branded ear bud casing is made of a high quality, polished plastic. The mesh inside is made of metal. The remote controller has a single button in the middle for play, pause, skip, receiving, ending calls and bringing up the google assistant on long press. It also has the volume controls +/- on it which work very well. The button is quite tactile and makes an audible, clicky sound on pressing. The microphone is quite clear and call quality is good. Noise cancellation is excellent. Kevlar fabric wires extend from the jack to the connector where the wires become thinner but are still of good quality and branch out to reach the ear buds. Rubber protectors at all the connection points make this a very sturdy pair of budget earphones. I got the green one. On screen it looks a lot like forest green but actually is a darker, better shade of bottle green. 03 pairs of small, medium and large size, silicone ear tips provided are extremely soft & comfortable, perhaps the best in the segment. The only con is perhaps the connector is not L shaped and hence prone to damage and also it is not gold plated but silver plated. But no loss of signal, connectivity noticed. And warranty is only of 06 months duration. I would rate the Realme Buds 2 sound signature after Sony MDR EX150AP, Blaupunkt EM 10 and One More Piston Fit in that order. Vocals are crystal clear and the high bass does'nt override the trebles or mid tones. Sound stage is pretty well balanced and clear and would help the PUBG enthusiasts in detecting footsteps, gunfire, reloading etc. Extremely loud volume but there is no distortion at full volume. Overall, a steal at Rs 599. Go grab one.\\n\", \"\\n  My review for Realme earbuds 2;One of the best wired earphone under ₹1000. Heavy bass, Good sound and sturdy built.Comes with tangle free braided cable which is of very good quality, cable above Y splitter's good but not braided. Built material is very good, cable organizer is an added advantage. Remote comes with 3 buttons for volume up/down, play/pause, Receiving/disconnecting call and play previous/next tracks.Now come to the sound, Bass is heavy and good. Mids and vocals are Ok. Preferred for bass lovers. Don't compare it with any 1200₹-1500₹ earphone but definitely one of the best in it's price segment.If handled with care they can last for minimum 2 years. Some buyers have complained that left/right earphone stops working after few days, Well I have not experienced the same but would like to inform that this earphone comes with 6 months replacement warranty for manufacturing defects, so if you face any problem, visit to the nearest service center.Must buy in 599₹.\\n\", \"\\n  I've been using these earphones for over 4 months and I am blown away by what they offer at this price.Pros:*Heavy BASS. These have a lot of bass which is clear and not muddy.*Surround sound. These earphones have a surround sound feeling. Like when you listen to a song, you'll be able to distinguish different instruments being played from different angles. This also makes them good for watching movies.*Sound Quality. They have a quite balanced sound. I won't say that they are on par with the high end earphones because these tend to get a bright on high volumes. This problem can be solved using the bass booster app.Cons:*The fit of these earphones are terrible for someone who has small ear canals. I have to litteraly dig these inside my ears and they would fall out again after every min. This was very irritating for me but once you manage to fit them snug and tight, there won't be a problem.*The placement of mic and volume rocker is placed too high and it causes the right earphone to fall when adjusting volume or picking up calls.Overall these earphones are the best you'll get under the Rs1000 segment. The mic quality is also decent. If you don't care much about sound clarity and are a daily basis lover or music listener then blindly  go for these. I have personally used Sennheiser's CX180 before and some other earphones of brands like Philips but all those earphones have a very bright sound and it would irritate you a lot. These Realme buds 2 crush all of them.\\n\", \"\\n  Arguably one of the nicest earphones in this price range. Sound quality is superb and almost no difference from earphones thrice it's price. Every genre of music sounds good enough and I'd advise to use the phone's equalizer to fine tune as per your taste and choice of music.The attention to detail is commendable. From the braided cable, magnetic eartips, to the organising loop to ensure never to have a tangled cable again, all goes to prove the research the team went through.Gifting it to a hyper organized friend and me being kind of one too, we both can appreciate these earphones. P. S. The price makes me appreciate it even more if possible.\\n\", '\\n  You can adjust the bass with equalizer and from my experience, that boom sound starts to tear apart if overdone. The reason why you\\'d wanna overdo it is cuz it lacked that \"quality bass\" that i experienced on my  Sennheiser cx 180 ii. Went for this one cuz i was on a budget and this has a mic.Pros:Good sound overallbraided cable and magnetic buds are GREAT!Volume buttonsnice build qualityCons:the fit is not quiet good, cuz of the material i guess. comes off loose after some time.mic - lets in all the ambient noise, the other users complained about my fan-air noise!If you can up your budget, go for Sen- 275 or something\\n', \"\\n  Excellent earphones for Bass heads. I've tried a lot of earphones over the years, so far the best earphone that i would highly recommend to the music lovers.Highs are good, but could be better.Mids are Fantastic.Let's talk about the BASS.. Its Head banging and thumpy i must say.Kind of hated the previous version of Realme buds.. But Buds 2 is Bang for your Buck..VERDICT : GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY HESITATION\\n\", \"\\n  Review after using it a week on Realmi 6 Pro, overall the product is good, but I feel like most of the reviews are hiped a bit cause. As a gamer the sound quality is not satisfying. For pubg and similar games the sound dirrection is not accurate where as other headsets of this price range offer better performance.I used 700 rs syska headset before  which offers very good audio quality and gaming experience. The audio quality of syksa is always great and iam a fan of it but, even though the cable looks strong but it won't last longer for me it was only 2 to 3 mnths only on all syska headsets I used. that's why I  stoped buying syska and changed to this one . I feel the cable quality is much better (note sure will update later) cause this is braided cable and offers a good audio quality for music and movies.But not recommended for gaming.\\n\", \"\\n  So, if you're looking for earphones in this price range (Around 600) This one may be a better choice. Why ? Well,1. Looks kinda premium and feels kinda premium too.2. The Two practical things, the magnet on the earbuds and the provided eartips are two little things that makes this one stand apart. Why ? Well, the eartips aren't made of single piece of rubber/silicon, where it joins with the earbud is made of slight tough material, and for that changing earbuds are freaking easy and hasslefree, I've seen this only in earphones costing arround 9-10k, seriously this little thing blew my mind.3. Ok, now sound. After using a no. Of earphones in this price range i can say it beats all the other ones except cx 180. Now there's a catch too. If you love bollywood, rock, and basically any other bass heavy musics this one would easily beat cx-180 provided u r listening at 70-75% volume, which i think enough loud even in the public places for most case scenario. Now The highs and lows are quite comparable too with cx-180.But, things totally change while u r listng classics, vocals... Cx-180 easily beats it. The mids in cx-180 are in just another level. Being said that this one also doesn't sound bad, actually this beats all the other ones in this range except cx-180..Another thing, in 90-100% volume this one distorts a little, but cx has no distortion.Now, one more thing, this one is not the bassiest, but it produces enough bass, and cx-180 doesn't come even close to the range of bass it can produce. Cx-180 is more of a balanced one.So, if u r not a basshead and, like country songs and old classics and prefer vocals then cx-180 is an easy recommendation.And, for modern musics, bass this one is perfect choice.4. Mic : cx-180 doesn't have one, and this one's has a ok mic, that picks up ambient noise too.. anyway that's quite expectable in this price range, as per my testing in this price range all the mics sounds more or less same.Indoor calls are quite clear, but in too much noisy places u might have to bring the mic closer to ur mouth, anyway this will get ur work done.5. It will take time to get used to the controls, although i find difficult to find play and pause the music sometimes, anyway that's not a big deal.6. The tangle free wire and those magnets does a great job.7. Comfort : For the utmost comfort I'll suggest to use the eartips of cx-180, by far cx-180 is the most comfortable I've used in this range.8. Anyway my cx-180 is arround 2 years old and still rocking, but definitely the wires if this are far better than cx-180. In terms of looks and builds it easily builds cx-180.9. As Far as u can manage the best eartip for u, it can block a fair amount of noise so do cx-180.And when u're listening in 70-80% volume both of them can block almost total noise arround u even in public places. Ooh ! One more thing cx-180 doesn't get that much loud that this one can.I think you'll get the idea, if it's for u, or not.***Buy the yellow ones, those are the sexiest.\\n\", '\\n  bought these after my sony earphones stopped working and im never shifting to any other brand for earphones , these are just amazing and the bass , treble and reverb are just awesome , the rubber ear grips also add a little bit of noise cancellation , but i have to admit these earphones sound better on my iphone than my realme XD , i have used it quite roughly for about 6 - 7 months and nothing has happened to it so far , its worth every single penny and i have reccomended these earphones to 3 of my friends and all of them loved it , definitely a must buy\\n', '\\n  I saw many youtube reviews and product reviews for these earphones and decided to buy one.All the reviews were mainly focused on braided cable, volume controls, magnets and bass. But after i tested them on MacBook Pro 2018, Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 and Redmi 3s Prime. I found out few things which you all need to know before buying them-1. Sound quality is decent, slightly bassy but not as much which YouTube reviewers have told about. Boat Basshead 225 is all you need if you are looking for that extra bass.The vocals are enough for a normal user.Highs are slightly suppressed and gets over powered when you max out the volume.2. Build quality is excellent for the given price. No complains regarding to it.3. Functionality- The volume buttons worked on all the devices i tested. Sometimes vol- button would glitch and on single press it would reduce the volume all the way down on MacBook Pro. But worked perfectly on other android devices.THE MIC JUST DOESN’T WORK ON 70-80% devices. It only worked on Redmi 3s Prime, on other devices it just didnt work. Initially i thought this would be manufacturing defect so i ordered a replacement as i was pretty happy with the sound quality and build quality that i was getting on these. But on replacement also the mic just didnt work.So i returned them as mic is what i need more  than volume controls.If you own any of Realme phones or redmi phones then go for it blindly, you’ll not get better package than these under 599.\\n', \"\\n  I literally ordered this THRICE. The first two times, it was a duplicate product and for the third time, the mic wasn't working. Especially, because it was meant as a gift. I couldn't even return it again because the other person felt bad for telling me that this time as well, it turned out to be defective! Like seriously? Why do y'all even have to give a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT! Not just once or twice, BUT THRICE!!!!!! -_-I gave 2 stars because even if the mic isn't working, it is okay for listening to music. The sound is fine. But the mic is the main problem.\\n\", '\\n  I have use the Sennheiser CX 180 Street II and bought this one recently and I must say Sennheiser is beast under the price bracket of 1000 rupees. This one is nowhere in sound quality near Cx 180 even in bass department.One thing I am satisfying with is build quality which is better than the Cx 180.But If want to buy a earphone again in future just go for the Cx 180 no doubt.Rating - 6.0 out of 10.\\n', '\\n  Excellent than boat bass heads225Best of real me buds 21.

There is only one problem for pubg players is, you can't find the right direction of sounds easily.Thank you, hope its usefull. Never watch YouTube reviews.\\n\", \"\\n  These earphones are of premium quality looks really nice fitting comfortable and it comes with two extra earbuds. For music it's really good.P. S. But for gaming it doesn't have left right channels so games like pubg can't be played as you can't judge the footsteps or gunfire location. It also applies on the music too try with any 3d songs sound comes form both end equally.Verdict: for someone who only listen to music and need for calling can buy this, for 3d music and gamers not serve the purpose.\\n\", \"\\n  Excellent product for the price. YouTube reviews talk only about how good the bass is, but the vocals, treble, surround sound is also pretty good. Overall it's a complete package. Don't just think this has good bass & nothing else. This is an all-rounder. My first purchase from the Realme brand, & I'm mighty impressed.\\n\", '\\n  For anyone looking for a pair of wired headphones, i think this is a wonderful choice. There are some things i liked and some things that i didn\\'t like so much:Pros:1) Sound quality: sound quality is very good. You\\'ll \"enjoy\" listening to music or watching your favourite netflix tv series. These are bass heavy and the vocals and music both are audible at almost any range. Plus they get pretty loud too2) Comfort: The ear tips are very comfortable and although i\\'d recommend using wireless headphones for workout if you do decide to workout in these, they won\\'t come off easily. Plus, the wire is braided so say good-bye to untangling your headphones in the middle of the road.3) Value: For the price i believe these are quite possibly the best out there right now.Cons:1) Mids: There is quite surprisngly no mids in these headphones. Ik that sounds weird but you\\'ll only know when you try it. When listening to music they sound a little low sometimes and as soon as you increase the volume by just 1 unit they\\'ll start sound a little too loud¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯2) No water resistance: Water resistance is not really common at this price point but it\\'d have been a good addition none the less as it gives you a piece of mind.If you\\'re buyung these for casual content consumption definetly go ahead but if you some other requirement i recommend you look into other brands like boat(for water resistance) or even the mi wired earphones\\n', \"\\n  ive been shopping online on this app but now i ordered this product. i already waited for 5 days to get earbuds and they delivered it with poor quality. where box already has seal broken and right bud one has no bass and less volume..now i requested for return after waiting 5 days now i think i will buy this product from store rather than online... i don't like this service ....  update: i returned the product sucessfully unfortunately there is no store open near me so trying my luck again buying product again #improvement - this app is better than other where return policy is good ive checked on other apps they are not accepting return even if they assure you 7 days return\\n\", \"\\n  ----------pros------------1)Bass quality is too good2)Sound Quality is perfect3)Cable is braided4) Quality of buttons is too good5) Mic position is perfect--------cons-----------currently didn't find anyi will update this review as soon as i find anything\\n\", \"\\n  Earlier We used to have braided cables in only premium wired earphones, But credit should be given to Realme for bringing this feature to the budget segment.Now, coming to the real substance: COMFORT AND SOUND:This is an in-ear style earphone, with soft silicone buds that fit snugly inside your ear canal. And if, by any means, you aren't comfortable with the one already attached, you can change it up with two other pairs bundled within the package.SOUND:Like many other earphones in the same price bracket, Realme Buds 2 are focused on giving us good bass. That said, the midtones, vocals and Highs are not ignored, though the highlight is clearly on the bass.FINAL VERDICT:If you are on a tight budget, then give this one a go guys, you won't regret it.\\n\", \"\\n  It could be certainly a good buy considering the attractive pricing but I didn't find it appealing. I've had used Sennheiser 180 & boat 225 previously so wanted to try something new and ended up buying this headphone.Pros: Excellent hardware, stylish, user-friendly especially for heavy user, additionally cones with magnet on back side of both the buds which could make it tangle free. Princing is also highly lucrative and considering the emerging RealMe as a brand could be a great option to get a nod. Sound quality is decent one and bass is slightly stronger.Cons: Though bass is stronger, the treble element is almost absent. If you are a Sennheiser or Boat user you could readily catch up those subtle nuances. High volume tend to distort a lot and seems unpleasant. If you are not an ardent music lover and don't mind all the above facets of a headphone then you can buy.I have already returned the item.\\n\", \"\\n  First of all I got these buds at 499 INR in a sale.These are the best in ear wired earphones I have used till now.If you are searching for earphones in Rs500 - Rs600 range these are the best in this segment.If u confuse between boat bass heads and these blindly go for this realme buds 2, because boat bassheads are slightly uncomfortable in fitting into ear and the sound is very much loud and punchy.I have used these realme buds 2 for 8 months in rough and tough conditions but they stayed strong and no damage is seen till now,the build quality is excellent and these are durable .Pros:1.Best Bass and sound quality.2.braided cable and tangle free design.3.cable organizer , helpful for people who keep them in pockets frequently and for travellers.4.big 11.2 mm drivers with magnets. if u don't use them, the magnets help the earphones stick around your neck without falling.5.strong and durable.they are robust and can give you a decent lifetime6.3 button control with decent mic for phone callsCons:1.The headphone jack is not L shaped.\\n\", '\\n  Build wise great.....and looks are astonishing!!Rest all is dumb too much bass in volume (Mids are great lows are also somewhat appreciable but highs are not good-Some distortion if listened on high volume)......I am a fan of SENNHEISER headphones the detailing is quite great in their wired headphone i would certainly go for them whatever their price are they are the king though i would say better than JBL and Boat headphones___In excess bass chart Boat>Mi>JBL>SENNHEISER the best is SENNHEISER whose all the aspects are balanced\\U0001f9d0🤑\\n', \"\\n  I'm using it for four months. This is basically a bass centric earphone. Good for gaming (footsteps are cristal clear in PUBG Mobile). I think it is considered as the best earphone in this price range. Overall sound quality is good. If you want to listen music with it, then your experience will be varied on the genre you listen. If you like hip hop (trap, rap, r&b etc) or something bass boosted, then it is for you. If you listen classic, pop, opera or anything else then you should think once again.Issue(s): The mic stopped working properly after few months. When the mic is touched, it sounds like a ktm duke. It is very annoying.Ther is an another problem with my friend's one. His right driver is sounding lower than the other one.We will contact to the realme service center before the 6 month warranty becomes void.\\n\", '\\n  The earlier realme bud was quite a disappointing so im glad that realme listened to its indian customers regarding the bass and fixed it in this version. Due to its bigger diameter the bass is huge. So if u are buying earphone for its bass than buy this with your eyes close.Pros:1. Thumping bass2. Braided cables3. Volume control button4. Cable organiser.5. Classy looksCons:1. No gold plated connector2. Not L shaped connector3. Hard to feel the play/pause button. Since this is use to pick/end calls and as a next/previous button, it should have been made in a way that u can feel it. But it is so hard to detect it.4. Due to the emphasis on bass. Sometimes it overpowers the mids and highs. Solution for it is to know the perfect setting for your equaliser.All in all good buy for its price.\\n', \"\\n  Review after three days of useSound:Tested on LG, Huawei, oppo, realme and a lap. So on oppo k1 and realme 3 pro the sound is very cheap. The sound and bass is more like echoed which will give you an headache within fraction of minutes. On LG v30 I can hardly differentiate between my sennheiser,B&O and this earphone. On Huawei it's somewhat good same goes for the lap.Product:1. The Cable feels good & rich in quality.2. The earpiece are soo small, it's good and light but you will also feel discomfort every time you put the earpiece on and off your ear.For 600 rs. This is the best earphone but is your phone sound driver good enough for it. So choose wisely.\\n\", '\\n  Best around Rs. 500.I have bought at 499.All in one package @ reasonable Price.Boat = Low BassMi = Low volume/soundBoult = High Bass with No balanceCx180 = Low durability\\n', \"\\n  Audio  quality is good for this Price range. Bass is good clarity is good. The magnetic tips are useful. You can change volume, stop - start and change the song with the help of the controller. Available in different colors. Mine is green. For day to day use definitely recommend.Bought 2nd time with different color. Like 1st one sound quality is above average and considering the price actually very good. Ample bass. Clarity also good. Added advantage of having volume control switch which is not very common in this range and it works both Android and ipad (tested). I think it's durable because I am using the first one for quite some time without any problem. Recommended for daily use.\\n\", '\\n  Purchased it for 500. little bit better sound than boat 242. wire quality is good below seperation of left right and average above seperation. boat 242 wire quality is better than this. I have used many earphones ranking below1 : creative ep 630(excellent sound quality poor wire quality)2 : cowon em1 (excellent sound quality and build quality)3 : Audio technica ATH clr 100 (excellent sound quality and build quality)4 : One more piston fit (good sound quality poor wire quality)5 : JBL C100 SI6 : Realme buds 27 : Boat 2428 : ant audio w56\\n', \"\\n  I'm not kidding you when I say that this earphone is just as good as Sennheiser CX 180.I have been using CX 180 for 4 years now and felt the need to switch to another brand because CX180 has a very thin wire and kept getting damaged leading to the sound not working in one ear.This earphone on the other hand has thick wires so if you're a rough user like me, you needn't worry at all.Coming to the sound, the sound quality is bang on. The bass is very good. I'm surprised to see reviews that say bass is bad. I was concerned about the bass after reading the reviews but it is at the level of CX 180 without a doubt.Where it doesn't beat CX 180 is in terms of noise cancellation. I would rate the noise cancellation of this earphone as average or above average.However, for the price range, this is a go to earphone.If you're concerned about durability, price and sound that is as good as CX 180, go for this earphone without any doubt!\\n\", \"\\n  It was the best earphones in the budget range it has a pretty good 11 mm drivers and sound quality is just amazing to listen any of songs any of movies and there is no noise cancellation it was just a rumour but best quality is also awesome finally e for this price range you can't get even a better product like this realme has done a very good job to give us a pocket friendly earphones to use everywhere anywhere for any years I love this product I hope you will also like this product it comes with realme cap which is useful to carry your earphones with tied up\\n\", '\\n  Very bad product. It sounds like a cheap Chinese product. It has a flat sound without any depth or bass. Not good for music lovers. Returned it the next day. Bought it from YouTube reviews. Buy earphones of higher prices to get better quality and performance. I choose sony mdx xb 55 ap. I got a fake product.\\n', \"\\n  Before reading this, please bear in mind that this is an unbiased review for earphones that cost Rs.600.There are thousands of earphones in the market ranging from Rs.50/- all the way up to millions of rupees and each having their own perks and features ranging from sound quality, build, size etc. Also, what I am writing is entirely what I personally feel as a musician, singer and a music programmer. Every human ear is tuned differently and every human has different tastes in music. So it basically means that whatever sound I perceive and enjoy through one particular type of earphone, such as the one is discussion, might not have the same impact on another individual using the same earphone. It is a very nice earphone for casual listening. I tried various different genres on different sound levels and graphic equalization. The sound stage is good. Outside noise cancellation is also fairly good enough. (Depends on the size of the earbuds and how they fit inside your ear canals). I was distinctly able to differentiate all the various instruments along with the lead voice. Earphones have sufficient bass and vocals are fairly justified. The fit is good on ears and they don't seem to fall off very easily during jogging. The cable is good enough, has a cable organizer and the remote works very nicely. So far, I am satisfied with the product and there are no complaints as far as my expectations are concerned. Small mention: The earphone side housing the remote is 'Right'.  Thank you for reading. :)\\n\", \"\\n  3rd day of use and I'm falling in love with this product by each passing day. This is the absolute best earphones i've got so far. I must say that it's actually better than the Sennheiser i own which costed around 3k.Coming to the pros and consPros-1. The bass is on point. It cannot disappoint you. Perfect for the Indian ears.2. Treble is equally matched with the bass3. Mic is close to the earbuds so that's a huge plus. Call quality is impeccable as stated by the receivers so far.4. Volume controls work almost flawlessly.5. Magnetic earbuds help the buds to stay together at all times.6. The braided wires are totally tangle free and easy to set. Although it might take a day or two of using to straighten out entirely.Cons -Do tell me if you find some. Because i couldn't find any so far.Hoping this helps potential buyers.\\n\", \"\\n  I'm amazed by the sound quality produced by these pair of earphones. The sound stage is spot-on as one can feel the surround sound effect and can clearly hear from which direction the music is coming. The Low, Mids and Highs are all well balanced and don't interrupt with one another. The bass is not overpowering like that of some other brands like Boats. Overall these are the best pair of earphones that money can buy at this price point.I'm very selective when it comes to headphones and have used several of them from brands like Sony, Sennheiser, 1More, Boats, etc and the Sennheisers are the ones I loved the most due to their balanced sound signature and details. Talking about Sennheiser, I have headphones like CX 213, HD202 II, CX 2.00G and out of them only the HD202 II is still functional as their built quality especially the wire quality is very bad. After regorous testing I found the Realme Buds 2's sound signature to be the closest to that of Sennheiser. And the built quality is great too at the price point of just Rs 600. Anyone looking for a good pair of headphones and don't want to spend a lot of money can buy them without any second thought.\\n\", \"\\n  It is a good improvement over realme 1. I have both but once i started using realme buds 2 , i can definitely see the difference in the sound quality. Both buds are good if i have to say. Realme is offering some cool earphones at cheap price. I didn't wanted to mention its cable is also very good quality and this will not tangle easily\\n\", \"\\n  I am writing this review after using it for more than month. I will review in on 2 ground.1) Sound Quality while Listening music or watching videos -It is awesome, Bass effect & all the effects are just great. If sound in recorded in stereo mode you will hear clear difference in every instrument played.BEST Quality.2) Call Quality - While using this head phone voice quality is very clear. Noise cancellation is best.While calling I was on highway though person on the other side heard no extra noise & it was very clear.Some other useful points are both the ear buds come with magnet & yellow band in there to tie it up nicely. Both this will help to not get clumsy while folding & unfolding of the wire.I know some cheaper options of Rs 250 to 350 are available but don't buy them. Buy this. You will not regret.\\n\", \"\\n  VerdictBuild quality is really great but the earphone head design is not so practical it looks odd. But don't it is not uncomfortable so that's a good sign.You get Braided wire and and the two earphone wires on the top are also of good quality.And you also get a cable management rubber attached to the wire that no one else is providing. So thumbs up for that.And one of my favourites is magnets in the earphones it come handy when you want to get in the metro checkup line they ask you to put your earphones down, so you just need to stick them together at the back of your neck. Its really great.The mic button is really close to the mouth so no need to bring mic closer to your mouth whenever you make a call.Now sound qualityOkay so the vocals were very clear and crisp.And the bass was a bit low i guess it not that thumping like one you get with the normal apple earpods not the airpods remember.But the vocals man they were sooo crisp.It gets even more good when you use it with any of the apple devices like iPhone and iPad cause the output through apple devices are really great. *I am not bragging about apple.Overall i would say definitely go with this one cause its a perfect balance of sound crispness and bass. Bass is there don't think there no bass but it's not that thumpy you know..Don't listen at very High volumes cause it starts piercing into your ears. You will get dizzy, cause i have experienced it.. cause i love listening at high volumes 😁. parents say you will ruin your ears but, can't help it,Pros( Quality )Braided cableReally long cableEarcups are of nice quality, got yellow accent in the interior3 buttonsMagnetic earpieceCable management rubberIf i would have to choose CONS then...Bass is a little bit low just bcz the vocals are so great that's why I am feeling this.3.5 mm jack is not goldAnd Jack is not angled it's straight*I would have rated it 4 if it the bass was more thumpy\\n\", \"\\n  I have ordered realme buds 2 and mi dual driver earphoes at the same time. The cost difference is 100INR and I really felt that the mi dual driver was worth its price.realme buds 2 are fine too, heavy bass, magnetic tips, and all... but long time usage is irritating because they hurt your ear.. The design is not as elegant as mi dual driver. Even the weight, I can feel them in my ear constantly. I don't feel that with mi Bluetooth (sports) earphones also which actually have the battery placed in the tips. I felt these earphones uncomfortable. Other than that, the performance and all is good.\\n\", '\\n  1st time Buying Realm product. I was wondering which one to buy after many positive reviews when compared to Mi dual drivers... So fixed for Realme buds 2 product.Really product is very good in terms of Quality of cable and features. The major drawback is bass, earlier I used JBL T210 which is great in  categories like Bass and sound but not cable quality (durability is missing) also costs 400 in more than realme buds.For pubg and for normal usage.. this one is great. If ur music lover just skip this product only bcoz bass is not upto mark.Overall Rs 599 value for money...\\n', \"\\n  For this budget I cant ask for more. The bass feels good and not muddy bass. The treble is a little muted but that doesn't make the high frequency soft. Bear in mind that I also use the Sony WH-1000XM3, so I know how a good quality headphone sounds! I use the sony at my home and bring the realme to my workplace and use that during commute. So to this review, this realme sounds good. You wouldn't be disappointed at all.\\n\", '\\n  [1] Due to 11.2 mm driver, it is louder than its competitors.[2] Earbuds are on heavier side and casing is big, that gives pain in long usage.[3] Bass is there, but it affects mid tones.[4] Due to its loudness, You should have to listen on lower volume around 70%, where Bass is simply missing.[5] Built quality is Average except main braided cable.[6] Controller is made up of cheap plastic.I have used Mi Earphones, that has better built quality.Mi earphone is not supper bassy but bass is there.If u can increase your budget go for Mi earphone which cost ₹699\\n', \"\\n  Realme buds2- feel the real bass.It justifies what it says, Feel the real bass.Just before this product, I have used proton boom3 4d and Boat Bass head 242. I did not like these two product due to product quality and bass when volume is low.This realme Buds2 also I thought to return after having the other two product experience but thought to gave a try.Starting my mobile column was 100percent so felt the awesome bass then I reduce the volume for 50percent and guess what, man , it is too good. At low level of volume also bass is too good. Tried with multiple language songs and result is awesome.Likes:Wire quality good and looks long lasting, bass is so good at low level of volume also, ear buds comfortable to ears, sound quality is good.Original product sold by appario retail seller.Delivery was within 12 hours of ordering. Thanks to Amazon and Appario retail. Keep it up.Dislikes:Control button kept just near to right ear which is slight discomfortable. But this can be neglected.I generally don't write reviews but felt like started writing about my experience with Amazon since I found difficulty to find the genuine review and seller experience.People who writes review, please write about seller name also since same product sold by multiple seller so that buyer have correct knowledge.\\n\", \"\\n  Build quality is good even though its a plastic housing and the braided cable feels sturdy.Talking about the sound quality: Currently I'm using Oneplus 7 pro, at first they didn't sound that impressive so I let them burn for about half an hour at 70 percent volume and then adjusted the equaliser after that I must say that they sound really good, the bass is punchy, mids are good highs are not that great but acceptable, the sound doesn't felt concentrated as commonly seen in the budget earphones. They can easily give compitition to earphones under 1400 bucks & definitely worth buying.\\n\", \"\\n  Better than CX 180, atleast product adequate amount of bass not near to bassheads 255, CX 180 in my opinion was always worst choice because the way those earphones were sound were terrible. As hearing from these would certainly be unexpected but atleast far better than CX 180 which is worst, it doesn'tcome with bass. After few hours just wanted to get rid of those, believe these are way better if not well reputed than senheiser but realme buds 2 justified at the price i got it. But real me buds is also underwhelming in terms of expectations\\n\", '\\n  Great Built Quality, Awsome sound Quality as I compared it with my Beyerdynamic custom Headphone 🎧 and Jays x Five Headphone 🎧I bought the green for me and the orange for my wife, they both are matt finished not shiny as shown in the picture, so I liked both the matt colours.If you want to spend ₹1500 on your headset, it is better to buy realme buds 2 since if it is misplaced or the wire which is great quality cut buy your pet, then you can buy it again😂\\n', '\\n  Product build quality was good.Wire quality is also good at the bottom braided and audio quality is ok for this price range with acceptable bass.Mic build quality could have been improved but mic sound quality is good.Noise cancellation is decent.Suggested for rough usage.Overall Recommended if you want braided cabled earphone with mic support and decent noise cancellation and good build quality.\\n', \"\\n  Purchase this headphone and in single day realised that the bass is not good. You can go for boat 225 having good bass. It's 3.5 mm audio jack not fit easily in some device like my laptop, keypad phone. These 2 place I used this but in laptop it's having loose connectivity and in keypad phone it doesn't fit at all. While my other headphone fit easily. Althaugh it's audio jack is not gold plated I think this is the main reason of loose connectivity. Not worth for money.\\n\", \"\\n  I bought this earphones after going through the reviews both on Amazon and some Youtubers as replacement for Samsung AKG headphones. My major use for the earphones is two fold - listen to music as well as attend conference calls.Realme Buds 2 exceeded expectations for first use scenario. The sound quality is rich and balanced. The BASS is  boosted from normal not too thumpy but a bit enhanced. All vocals and music sounds are quite crisp and clear. Also, build quality is top notch at the price point. It gets quality braided cable, good quality buttons and ear-tips. Additionally, you also get a cable organiser permanently attached to the cable. +1 to that.Coming to the second use scenario - using the mic functionality for conference calls. It was so bad that people at other end of line continuously complained that my voice is too low. Even when I spoke very loudly the people had trouble hearing what I sopke. Have never faced this issue in my years of working experience with any headphones - be it nokia, sony, samsung akg, creative or jbl. Based on the experience asked for a replacement thinking there is an issue with my unit. But the replacement unit had the same issue with the mic - the other person can't hear you loud enough. Ultimately, have to return them.\\n\", \"\\n  I'm not a tech expert but an average user like almost all of you, so my review is in simple language.Sound Quality - Awesome, super voice, when i put it on my ears it's like feeling from other world.Noise cancellation - It works like that there is no noise in reality. For an average user you will not hear outer voices. Also there are 2 noise cancellation mic at both earphones head.Bass Quality - super duper, bass is best in it, i can't exactly express but it's bass is very good.Build quality - lower half is having a fabric coated wire which help it last longer and also it is intangible + we gets a strap by help of which we can fold and hold it, i uploaded a image of that.Mic quality - Very good, comparable to other earphones it's awesome, i sometimes record videos using it's mic instead of my boya mic and voice quality is near about same.It comes with 2 extra pairs of earbuds for 2 different ear sizes + it's earphones head's back is magnetic, sometimes it's showoff and sometimes it's useful i use magnets to stick it behind my neck when i want to remove it from ears but don't want to put in pocket.After all its an awesome earphone.Only reason i gave 4 starts is that the box was little bit damaged so i thought let's cut a star but product works really awesome.\\n\", \"\\n  The reason I bought this product is because it has 3 button remote. The column down and pause/play work but the volume up doesn't work. I requested replacement and the new one is exactly the same. My old samsung earphones work (3 button too) so its not an issue with phone. I can't even return this product since it only has 10-day replacement option. If the buttons work like they're supposed to, then its easily a 4 star product.\\n\", '\\n  Its an Average Quality stuff . Sound - 3/5 .. Noise Cancellation - 3/5 and Bass - 3/5 .Physical Quality of the Headphones are good and might last for sometime.Packaging of the headphones is such that you would believe a Mobile inside ... lol . why so Sophisticated Packaging for headphones rather give cost benefit to consumer with minimum packaging . Overall just OK to buy but alternatively you have millions of Options to choose from !\\n', \"\\n  I am using it from almost 5 months. Honestly it's awesome. Perfectly fits in ears. It doesn't need any earhooks to fit in ears like boat earphones. And it's 3.5 mm jack so much properly fit in phone. It also has a little surround sound effects but don't know why company never tell us about it. And bass quality is awesome. Very deep sharp bass. And loudness is so much. Even I can't use it over 85% sound. And I got it in just 500 rs... It unbelievable package to me. I'm a boat user but honestly realme buds 2 properly hands down boat basshead 225.\\n\", \"\\n  Got these for 459 rupees. When compared to more expensive offerings, it holds up well (coming from someone who usually purchases earphones round the 1000 rupees price point).Wanted to save some cash this time so I chose these realme buds. For half the price of my usual earphones, it definitely doesn't feel like half the quality.Pros:1. The braided finish of the wire feels durable.2. Bass is good. Mids and highs are acceptable.3. It adequately blocks out ambient noise.4. The default tips fit well.5. Volume control with a dedicated microphone and button to take/end calls.Cons:Nothing much really once you consider the price. You get bang for your buck. If better sound quality is desired, be prepared to spend double the money.Conclusion:Buy it without hesitation. 5 stars.\\n\", \"\\n  Okay this is a good earphone but not for bassheads.I always had bought earphone between the price range 900-2000.But last time I decided to go a little bit lower and bought mi dynamic bass because all my earphones works only for like 7-8 months and that's okay cuz I use my earphones all the time so it's obvious that it's speaker will burn earlier.And to be honest I bought that for my mother without any research and coincidentally my sound Magic's E10c left one stopped working so I kept that,and boy I was surprised with the product the bass was really really good you can say same as Senhieser's Cx180.Highs are okay they sound little bit 'dabba dabba' but after that I decided not to spent too much on earphones.So first I bought bass boat head 152 after reading reviews and thought considering price range they are good but bass is horrible.Returned them still not got the refund but then I searched and got this one as after seeing YouTube videos and reviews I thought it has genuinely good bass.But here we are again disappointment.I don't think people here in review actually know what actually bass is.Read many reviews comparing it with cx180 and cx213 trust me it was nowhere near them.I needed a mike that why I bought this one not cx180 and also both mi dynamic bass and one more piston are unavailable.Don't get this wrong these earphones are good in mids and highs comfortable and buitl quality is good but literally you won't feel the bass that literal vibration in your head.So if you wanna have good bass these are not for you.\\n\", '\\n  Disappointed:- my cable organizer is missing...Pros :-This earphones have decent quality wire and sone extra features like magnetic buds and mic etc...Cons:-Not L shaped jack...But major things missing is its sounds quality.( Afterall you want to buy earphones to listen sounds so sounds quality must be satisfactory )I am not saying that it has bad sounds but definitely not as level of sennheiser cx 180...( If you want to spend 100 rupes extra then definitely buy sennheiser cx 180 instead of this realme buds 2 )Note :- i have used sennheiser cx 180 for 3 years and realme buds 2 for 1 week .....( I am writing this review on the basis of my experience of using this two different earphones )\\n', '\\n  Writing this review after two weeks of usage. I was not impressed with many of the well-known brands (would not like to name them and due to inexplicable reasons they seem to have high ratings for reasons beyond my understanding). I am not an audiophile but have the knack to pick up subtle differences, and this earphone is better than those within the range of 500 - 1500.\\xa0 Decent bass, good clarity, good noise cancellation and most important for me was its build quality since I am a rough handler. Does the job for me.\\n', '\\n  Note-Totally unbiased opinion.Used both of them before,if you want earphone for bass only then you can go for boat bassheads 225 (realme is just behind boat)but for overall sound quality go for realmeUsed boat before definitely have to face problem in its comfort😒😒BASSBoat(4.6/5),realme(4.0/5)realme bass thumping feels good but not as high as that of boat.SOUND QUALITYBoat(4.0/5),Realme(4.5/5)Realme all things are good balancedCOMFORTBoat(3.6/5)Realme(4.5/5)when use Boat for long duration it creates headache 😑😑DURABILITYBoat(5/5),Realme(4.8/5)Boat gets an advance of l shaped connector which makes it more durable.Wire quality of realme is better than that of boat.In my opinion you should go for realme buds 2\\n', '\\n  I have been using this earphone for about 3 months now and I can sum up the experience in following points:1. If you are way too much into bass then these are amazing earbuds for you in this price range (with mic)2. The mids (vocals) and highs (treble) are quite disappointing.3. The mic is amazing and can be used for official calls as well.4. The vocal separations are also mediocre at best.5. People who are going to use these earphones for gaming (PUBG, COD) are going to be happy because the footsteps, firing sounds are very crisp and clear.Conclusion: If you are looking for good build quality and bass only then these are the earphones for you, but people who want an overall music experience and are more inclined towards pop etc. you are likely to be disappointed.\\n', '\\n  Just amazed and fully satisfied by REALME BUDS 2 earphones. The overall package is durable and quite impressive. The most important thing is that the sound quality is THE BEST. The noise reduction is good. I could clearly recognise the left, right and center audio adjustment. The magnetic earbuds, the tangle free wire and the black metallic glow with yellow color markings will catch your attention. But, the one thing that you will love is the earphone remote as it has multiple functions on its single, double and triple click. Never seen this option before in any earphone. I would definitely recommend you to buy this product.\\n', '\\n  Received product recently, first impressions-Pros-1. Packaging2. Build qualityMediocre-1. Sound quality ( I\\'m a guitarist I know thing or two about it)Sound is ok but somehow it\\'s bass and treble boosted. So mids are very suppressed, ie you\\'ll hear bass and high pitch sounds but subtle music isn\\'t very crisp. Hence good \"reviews\" are bit misleading and music sounds less powerful and average.Cons-None\\n', '\\n  Bought these at ₹499 in sale & in that price segment these are good if not the bestThey do come with some unique features like Magnets ,  Duarble Cables & Cable Organizer .Build Quality : 4/5Sound Quality : 4/5Bass : 3.5/5Noise Cancellation : 3/5Only concern I have with the magnets is that they tend to stick to metallic surfaces when near them & get small scratches on the rear surface with Realme logoBut other than this i have found no problem & i am mostly satisfied with the quality considering the price\\n', \"\\n  1stly the build quality is top notch. But as talking to the music, some kind of sharp sound comes when you leasten you fav songs.. 2ndly the bass is 4 out of 5. Not completely satisfied.. but in this price range you can't expect more. Vocals are Cristal clear. High pitch Songs are a little annoying in this ear phone. Overall good . But I recommend mi standard ear phone instead this, which will cost you around 699. Real me bud 2 gives Some more features as compared to mi. Like magnetic heads, wire organiser. It's an ohk product for an bass lover. Thank you.\\n\", \"\\n  A very genuine review from a daily user who likes bass and loud mids as well1) Quality of cable Excellent seems long lasting2) buds quality good will hold well in ears3) Sound quality - Bass comparable to JBL earphones and real bass you can feel the huge thump in your earTreble mids and vice volume looks like you sitting in DOLBY theatre ....AWESOME QUALITY ...Not even single iota of doubt4) Magnets buds tangle free5) Voice quality awesome on mic5/5 go straight forward and. Buy this you won't regret..Have tried JBL as well these REALME BUDS are awesome beleive me\\n\", '\\n  At 500inr this earphones are really good.Sound quality is not as good as really high end earphones but much better than other earphones in the market under 1000-1200rs category.The fit in ear is just perfect as the earbuds are at an angle and fits inside the ear canal perfectly and do not fall out at any angle.Lastly, the best part is the earbuds sticks to each other with magnets,hence the earbuds alwys stay together.Never seen this feature in any earbuds at this price point so thumsup for that RealMe !!!!.\\n', \"\\n  I wouldn't ever go for this brand. It's very cheap quality plastic which breaks open even on slight impact. Sound it just toooo high it hurts your ears. Ive used many earphones but this one was just too loud to hurt ur ears dosent have balance in anyway. Also the button are there but it good for just to increase and decrease the volume, middle button is just usless. If you looking to get this for pubg or any other gaming then it's a big disappointment because it doesn't even give pro surround. I'd like to give this negative 5 rating.\\n\", '\\n  So I ordered this product 2 months ago in lockdown and i found this really amazing as it had noice cancellation and the bass is pretty good tooi basically used this for gaming purposes but today the product just stopped working there was no damage oh the outside it just stipped working i hope this only happened with me because this product seemed pretty good to me but if this is a major deal with everyone that the product stops working then this is a bad point about the realme buds 2 so overall i have the product 5 star rating as it deserves i just want a raplace of this product as it is in warranty\\n', '\\n  Wire quality and over all build quality is pretty good. Packing is also very good. Packing is better than boult x1Vocals are foodGood bass alsoMagnet is useful to keep earphones or tie in neckIt comes with flexible strip which is very useful to tie and keep earphones.Wish they would have given the all black option too.Over all quality is pretty good. Price is also good purchased for 599.\\n', \"\\n  Duplicate earphones not original mic doesn't work and noise cancellation not even possible .don't buy here buy on real me store it's the best option.\\n\", '\\n  This is possibly the best option within Rs. 600.You will literally get blown away by its bass!!Especially with an additional bass enhance in equaliser. Its bass generation capability is so high that it tickles my ears/ vibrates little bit at times.You will not hear any outside noise if u put it on and play song even in low volume.Bass and treble has a great balance. The clarity of sound is really remarkable. I accidentally washed a pant with this headphone in it. Guess what after 3-4 days I let it dry off, not only the product remained functional the sound was just as great!!Really happy with the purchase!!\\n', '\\n  Honestly this is come with very good Build Quality, sound quality. Sound was amazing for every type of Lister. Remote having volume control which is not seen any kind of earphones having the same price category so it is best things. Bass is too nice. So much improved from realme buds 1.Just one thing missing is L shape jack pin...else everything is perfect. Very comfortable earpiece and also feel very lightly while plugin ears. No headache for cable and buds are so smooth. Loved wear for long time.\\n', '\\n  When  i get these ear buds the down volume button is not worked and i replaced them ,,then also the same problem the volume down button is not working,, The seller sending waste products ,Dont buy these ear buds ,,buy JBL CS200SI  for SUPER SOUND,BASS AND FOR CALLS ,,,these are time waste\\n', '\\n  Out of the box sound quality is not that great bass is good & all the sound becomes clearer when u play with the equalizer a bit. & choose ur desired sound profile...the picture given is my sound profile on vlcVolume of the earphone is very good about 40-50% volume on mobile is clearly audible..build quality is amazing...ear tips are comfortable the wire quality is very good..all the buttons are working pretty well...its a nice product\\n', '\\n  Such a great earphone. I was only using JBL for last couple of years and just ordered this one this time and I am completely happy with this product.This is great headset with extremely nice sound quality and build quality too..nice bass nothing more nothing less Just accurate. And honestly when you see the price its very less when compare to the quality of the product.Realme did an amazing job\\n', '\\n  Bought it a month ago, now left earpiece is not working. Trying to connect with realme service, will update the review soon.Update: tried calling service center, but nobody was responding. So decided to hit that bud on the wall.. i did.. now both are working fine.\\n', '\\n  \"Bass is like a boss\". I have used so many earphones till date. Till date JBL was my favourite. Recently I came across and I wish to give a try as I need to fit it with in the budget.Pros: Appearance cool, sound quality is clear, Bass is the highlight. I never got such a wonderful experience for this price till date. Bass will make you blast for sure. The mic works fine. The wire is a wringle free. Built quality seems good.Cons: The crispyness and the treble is little drawback. But you must accept that you can\\'t expect that in this price range. 10/10 for this price.\\n', \"\\n  It's a really awesome earphone under Rs.600 !!Bass is great. Sound Quality is amazing. Calling experience is great. It has volume up & down buttons which is very handy! It has tangle free wire and a rubber band to adjust the size of the wire according to your need! Overall I loved it very much. You can go for it! 😊\\n\", \"\\n  These are insanely good Basshead earphones! But they sound even better when paired with a DAC! I own high end earphones and I just bought this for calling purposes as my IEMs don't have a mic lol! It's a bang for the price and will only suggest these to bass lovers who listen to Techno, Psytrance, Progressive house and other genres with bass heavy sounds!\\n\", \"\\n  Hi , if your budget is below 1000 don't buy this . There are better earphones than this . You can buy this if you have a budget of 600. But people having a budget of 1000 or less don't get this .I have used sennheiser cx180 and compared to them realme sucks .Quality of realme buds 2 is good but the sound sucks. Feels like some cheap earphones .\\n\", '\\n  -Earbuds looks great, feels funky-good bass and treble (sometimes treble feels sharp)-good build quality-organizer strap is useful-comfortable earbuds and fits perfectly in ears-feature pack controlsMiddle button Triple tap for previous track not working on my Realme 2 pro, checked with moto G4 and redmi phone & it works well with those, cant understand Realme earbuds not working properly with Realme phones itself.\\n', '\\n  Youtuber paise Lekar Badhai kar rahe bass thoda theek hai sound quality acchi Nahin Hai..... Poor 👁\\n', \"\\n  The product feels like it's nicely built..But the microphone is the worst. While making calls the receiver doesn't get a clear voice.This earphones nearly brought my relationship to the end.The audio quality is good bt the mic is worst..I love the way Realme does the packaging...If you are looking for good Earphone the must go with realme...Thanks to realme for launching products in this price range...\\n\", \"\\n  Now a days, realme creates a buzz in their audio segment too. After a lot of research and roaming on internet I decided to try realme buds 2 finally. I am writing this review after using couple of months. So, directly moving to the review now.Following features is quite noticeable atlest these things attract me most about the product. So, here it is:-1. 11.2 mm bass boost driver: which is really boost my ears..you can find some quality bass with this audio driver. Good for bass lovers actually. Mids are average but you can clearly identify the low thumping in your ear drums that soothing your taste for bass.2. Built in magnetic behind the ear drum looks nice as a pair. Nicely designed narrower to the edges.Fits really well inside the ears.3. Anti twinning cable: you can easily distinguish cables they did not mix up actually. Cable quality is good.So, this features make it more acceptable to me.4. Cable organizer: You can organized cables of your headphone with a nice yellow organizer which is an additive features in this price segment.5. Volume control: To control the volume they clearly mentioned + and - sign with yellow marker. Feel like more premium to use.6. Budget friendly: If i would talking about the price segment its really suits within your budget. Definitely, i can say it giving the best bass than others in this price range. But, my request is,that don't compare this to JBl or sennheiser, because they are meant to be classic, can't deny their supreme bass in this regard. Realme can give a close competitive performance with product like boat basshead, boult audio, ant audio etc within this segment.Verdict: So, finally the time came to an end. Lets make things clear, realme is a new player among others in this audio segment if you wish just give it a try, it's bass is not that dreadful.\\n\", \"\\n  I expected much better than this. But really disappointed with these headphones.Sound is not clear always have that buzzing effect in background.Can't even watch movies with these , i don't know why may mine are faulty or something or i was using better earphones for long time . But i feel like i just wasted my money on these.Not good for music lover or if you want to experience clear sound then go above 1200 you'll get much better and satisfying product.If your budget is low I'll recommend Sennheiser cx180.Hope this will help\\n\", '\\n  I have mixed feeling about this product. Sound quality I feel is not up to the mark and there are earphone available in the same price bracket gives better sound quality (was using boat earlier). But I am surly impressed with the built quality of realms earlphones. Inadvertly I forgot to take out of my pocket before machine wash and it servived not once but thrice which is remarkable.\\n', \"\\n  I will say only one Thing Feel the Music and Movie🎧♥️😘Love The design the quality of sound is just way beyond our expectations ...must have been Designed with all acoustic considerations ...Balanced sound quality &  pleasant experience....I'm the kind of person who don't compromise over sound effects whenever I watch movie or listen to music...If you are just like me😉 then don't waste your time reading more reviews...😊 Just Go for it....👍✌ Thank Me later for this amazing Review....Thanks Realme for bringing this experience at such low cost ....😇\\n\", '\\n  *NOT FOR BASS LOVER* Go fot bOAT Brand for better all over performance and quality* Delivery by amazon was good as per promisePros:-3.5mm to Left right distribution wire is very good quality- Audio is clear and loudness is very high (BASS IS VERY VERY VERY LOW)- Ear plug is soft, extra size plugs are givenCons:-Left Right diatribution to ear wire is not good quality rubber, looks like it will break easily- Looks like very cheap quality plastic overall-AVERAGE AUDIO QUALITY- PATHETIC BASS\\n', '\\n  Pros.1. 11.2mm Bass Boost Driver.2. Magnetic tips.3. Volume adjustment switch with play and Pause Button with Mic.4. Cable organiser.Cons.1. No flat tangle free wire. The wire is a polyester cloth covered wire which gets tangled and Twist.2. Jack quality is of worst quality plastic covering. It is not gold plated L shaped rubbery plastic covered metalic jack. It will easily break if not properly handled.3. No next or previous buttons.\\n', '\\n  I am writing this review after 6 months of using this headphone. The first 5 months were perfectly fine. Here are some pros and cons.Pros:Budget friendlyLesser tangle hasslesNoise cancellation 7/10Bass 8/10Magnetic bullets are helpfulCons:Stopped functioning properly after 6 months of use.Internally damaged/issue with bushing cord joint/jack joint like most of the other earphones.Play/pause button is not that user friendly.\\n', '\\n  Using for over a month now with my Realme X2 Pro and totally satisfied with the Product Quality, Audio Quality, Built Quality and Above all Terrific Performance. Excellent Bass, Cristal Clear Mid Range and Vocalist are really impressive. Total compatibility with Dolby Atmos! Just Go For It! An Excellent Product Available In This Price Range! Great Value For Money!\\n', \"\\n  At this price point and this performance either you can get Mi earphones (not the basic) or this low budget bomb.I have in recent years used many earphones (below ₹1000) Jbl,sony,boat,Ant audio ,boat(worst) but believe me this earphones are the bang for the bucks.Many people are saying it have overpowering bass or audio clearity is not upto mark,but i say they have bad phones, because the audio output also depends on the phone you are using.Some are complaining about the buttons not working,i tried this on OnePlus,Mi, Google pixel..all buttons were working fine.Some complaining about cable length,it is 1.2 meter cable,how long do you want guys?The earphones are of solid build and very light weight,the audio quality is awesome,noise cancellation is very good, perfect bass and sound stage is also decent at this price point.Feel and looks premium.Only downside is 6 months warranty only,but overall full packageGo for it blindly.. you won't regret\\n\", \"\\n  To those who say headphones sounding average, please Don't expect 10000 rupees headphones quality when you are paying 600 rupees Lol 😆, I tried with Lenovo k6 samsung s6 and LG Q6 mobiles and it sounds good but in vivo it sounds distorted, and for the price of 600 build quality and sound is good.Note: Sound quality vary from mobile to mobile.\\n\", '\\n  Burma bazaar 50 rupees  earphone make better sound delivery than this worst ever realme buds 2....for just 15 minutes usage in 70% volume my ears are paining for more than hour... poor bass and Treble balance with distorted loud sound.... clarity missing ... except look its total disaster just a showcase product .. even MI Basic 399 better than this...I returned and move to Sennheiser CX180\\n', \"\\n  Today I would like to compare it with JBL c100si.In terms of build quality Realme slightly better. Realme is 1inch longer than JBL c100si. But Realme gives 6 months warranty and JBL gives 1 year warranty. Both has mic. But JBL has one control button and Realme has three buttons, one control button and other two to increase or decrease volume. JBL hasn't any rubber band/strap to organise it's cable. Realme cable are braided nylon cord whereas JBL use normal rubber material cable. Though both are tangle free, but Realme is better in terms of cable quality and to manage it's cable than JBL.Now comparing sound quality, I found JBL far better than Realme. Many YouTube blogger said that Realme sound is best in ₹600 -700 price range earphone segment because of it's 11mm driver. They gave better position to Realme than JBL. Though Realme has 11mm driver, but it's sound is noisy. JBL sound quality is smoother than Realme. Bass and treble everything is clear and the sound doesn't disturb your ear. I can say it sounds like Sony music system. You will surely love to listen music with JBL c100si earphone.In terms of fitting, both are good. But JBL has little bit edge over Realme because of it's shape. And Realme is slightly heavier than JBL.Regarding call quality, I didn't find any difference in call quality in either of these earphones. The sound is clear in both ends.Hope this review will give you a clear idea to choose the right one...👍\\n\", \"\\n  Good sound qualityGood noise cancellationBass quality is little lower than expectedSound is little bit louder when using max vloumeAm using realme buds 2 headset with my realme X2 and it's perfectly matchingPlay/pause, volume +/-, double tap to next track is working fine, but triple tap to move to previous track is not working and tried it in many ways with lightening click but it moves to next track and pause the song due to 3rd tap. Will feedback to realme to make a fix on this issue.\\n\", '\\n  Very nice earphones. Half cable is breaded (from 3.5 mm audio jack to split point). Quality of cable is very nice and feels somewhat premium. Earphone material is very sterdy. Silicon tips are very comfortable to wear.You can control volume levels as well. Cable quality is very nice.Overall good product in this price range.\\n', '\\n  These pair of earphones are a value for money buy. Bass quality and noise cancellation is quite good. The ear pieces have a magnets at the back which make them stay together. The functioning of the buttons on them may vary with the cell phone you use for example the + and - change songs in some whereas in others it increases and decreases the volume. Length of the wire is fine. Overall, neat product. Loved it❤\\n', \"\\n  This time switching from Boat to Realme after using almost 4 years and having doubts on this decision of change, as you all know, what the quality standard already set by Boat !! I'm also a fan of boat, what a sound quality, build quality, too good !!But, but but,Realme was also not going to disappointed you !! As because of sound quality, build quality and it's light weight too. Bass was also good, but I feel little bit extra, some people's may like this, but over all experience was simply good. Real competition to boat, nice and happy to have a good change, you can also go for it, at this price. The most sad thing is that, it's completely made in china.Music quality: 4.2/8Bass: 4/5Sound Balance: 4/5Wire Build Quality: 4.5/5Plugged In Jack: 3.8/5Microphone: 3.8/5Overall Experience: 4/5\\n\", \"\\n  The sound quality is really great, and if your device has Dolby Atoms the music you hear would be really good. Definitely not recommended for gaming as this headphones lacks most of the game sounds, as this won't pick up those mild sound from games. When compared with other high range budget headphones, this has almost the same bass as there isn't much difference and works well.\\n\", '\\n  I am using this product from last 2 weeks  and find comfortable in terms of music and phone calls usage.Wire quality : GoodVolume: GoodMusic : GoodWire length: Good and appropriateGame volume: GoodNever required to listen music or while playing game in full volume. Volume of sound is really good. Voice clarity is good during phone calls.Overall satisfied with this product.\\n', '\\n  This is for bass lovers. Bass has been enhanced for the feel of the thump. Also sturdy product. Much improvement over realme buds 1. Treble and vocals are decent and its louder than headphones sold at 600/- pricetag. Do not compare it with headphones sold at 2500/- and above. However, its a good competition to headphones sold within 1000/-. It has a premium feel to it and stylish too.\\n', \"\\n  It's sound clarity is good overall but it's definitely not durable its onlt been one day its already damaged a Little if u want this for a long time then definitely don't go for this\\n\", '\\n  Mind blowing! They sound unbelievably good for this price!The sound quality is miles ahead of my original AKG headset which was included in the box with my Samsung Galaxy S10.Pro tip: The sound reproduction is pretty loud, adjust your EQ to balance our the low-end or high-end frequency as per your preference.Definitely recommended to audiophiles!\\n', \"\\n  The product is one of the best in this price range. I always prefer Boat as my earphone because of its punchy bass at this price range and durability. But the Realme buds 2 has surprised me altogether.First of all the build quality seems sturdy not the usual plasticy feelBass is punchy for a sub 1k earphone but whatsa surprising is it's passive noise cancellation. Its pitch perfect in cancelling the sorrounding noise entirely.Sound quality is very crisp and bass are on the lower side but treble is good.Overall a 4.5 based on value for money\\n\", \"\\n  Everything a earphone should provide like amazing sound quality ,next level bass , next level noise cancellation like even if the music is of and you're wearing the earphones you cannot hear the environment . I've been using it since 1 yr now loved it very durable earphones . ❤️\\n\", '\\n  I had bought this earphones for 599 and at this price range it beats all the competition in the market. I have tried many earphones like JBL, Ubon Prime, Boult, Samsung but none of them could get even close to the quality this particular earphone offers. Realme is a company which is known to disrupt the competition in the market, be it the smartphone, smart band, smart watch, smart TVs and the same is continued in the earphone segment as well.Bass : 10/10Clarity : 10/10Noise cancellation : 10/10Durability : 9.5/10Value for money : 10/10The unique selling point of these particular\\u200b earphone is the 11.2 mm Bass Driver. The equaliser of these earphones are perfectly balanced. The highs, mids , vocals and bass are very well balanced and the bass despite being strong does not disrupt the details of the song and also the big driver helps produced high volume sound which does not hurt the ears. The earphone best sound at around 40-60% of volume with punchy bass and clear vocals. Also the 45 degree angled outlets and great fitting silicone eartips help in outside noise reduction which play a vital role in sound clarity of the song.Realme buds 2 have a nylon braided cable in the lower end and rubber coated cable at the upper end both of these feature increase the durability of the product.Also the good point is that the cables are thick when compared to other products which is very promising for durability.There is no major cons of the product but if asked for suggestions I would suggest to please provide a gold plated and L-shaped jack with whole length nylon braided cables. The sound department is the best and please do not make any changes to it.\\n', '\\n  PROS:• BASS IS AWESOME• GREAT BUILD QUALITY• TANGLE FREE• CABLE ORGANIZER INCLUDED• NOISE ISOLATION WORKS LIKE MAGIC• TOO MUCH COMFORTABLE.• SURROUND EFFECT IS VERY GOODCONS:• HIGHS OR VOCALS ARE VERY LOW• BASS MUFFLES THE MID TONES.NOTHING MORE TO COMPLAIN I GOT IT FOR  ___399RS ___(100RS DISCOUNT FOR GREAT INDIAN SALE AND MORE 100RS DISCOUNT FOR PAYING WITH AMAZON PAY.)\\n', '\\n  Pros:Quality Sound.Flexible n Best for Rough use.Best wired earphones till now.Inbuilt n outer quality is Great!Best deal in these price range.Ultimate noise cancellation.Cons:Sound reduces sometimes, if so pls remove the buds n clean it after long use.Only available in 2 color\\n', \"\\n  Mic, buttons & output is Excellent .... But Looks Used 1 !Angled Jack would be Appreciated for Buds 3 ;-)Braiding is GoodWhile Packaging. .. the earpiece got stuck in Plastic slot took me 2 mins. To gently pull out is Next to impossible . Improve Packing material .. Looks like it'll damage the product ... & Your Product will fail due to box 📦 ...Box  slots were Too Tight\\n\", \"\\n  Great product from Realme and particularly for the price it is launched. Sound is good with good low, mid vocals. Also the bass output is really good. The 11.5 mm driver really helps to enhance the bass. Clearity is good but don't compare it with earphone greater than Rs. 1000/- But this is really great product for Rs. 599. Worth to purchase.\\n\", '\\n  There is both positive and negative for this productPositive things :Bass quality next levelMagentic budsSound quality and speakers inside the budsNegative things : wire quality very poor and delicateMic functionality s not good.hardware part of complete product is very badNote : Felt like Use and through product599 is worth only if it comes atleast 1year life\\n', \"\\n  This is overall an intelligent choice.want to know why?Bass is perfect, won't hurt your drums.(eardrums)Sound is clear and pleasantQuality is so fineMic is above averageThe only negative thing is only 6 months warranty.Bhai 1 saal ki to do kam se kam.\\n\", \"\\n  Waste of money. Full of false rating. No return of item don't get fool by reading the reviews. Think before you buyUpdate: I called customer care and product returned successfully.\\n\", \"\\n  Being amongst music listener, I feel the loudness was so higher that it doesn't make us get in to the music for a long time. There must be some softness in the noice quality in the speakers,which will make you feel calm and keeps you listen the music for a long period. This softness was not found in the headphones though it has loudness and base at the peak.Better to listen in the less volume,but then it'll be difficult to listen small small instruments in the background.Still the design and built quality made me impress to look good and hope no damage in long time uses.\\n\", \"\\n  \\xa0Used these earphones for 6 days. When I plugin and play anything, the first 5-10 seconds of the audio appears as if you have a cold and your ears are clogged. Then soon the audio plays in a clear sound, and you feel as if your ears aren't blocked anymore.Built Quality: Barring the buds that are meant for the ears, nothing looks solid, forget about longevity. And the braided wire reminds me of the school shoe laces that I used to tie when I was little. No tangles, agreed. But the quality of the so called braided wire is very very fragile. (Attached a video for your reference)Sound Quality: Please refer to the 1st para. About the initial sound quality.The bass looks adequately decent. Pretty loud yes. But 50% volume is more than enuf, if you increase anymore, you would feel as if they're singing in your ears or rather shouting.Bass is the only plus point.Nothing's sooo great about these headsets, if you go by the hype people are ranting about. They're only Impressed by the bass and writing off. I would rather suggest a better pair of headsets from Portronics( which I used earlier - conch 204)Returning after 6days usage.My suggestion: If you are an average user, once in a day- go ahead.If you use it almost all day, you might wanna take good care of these earphones.\\n\"], 'url': 'https://www.amazon.in/Realme-Buds-Android-Smartphones-Black/dp/B07XMFDHSG/ref=sr_1_17?dchild=1&fst=as%3Aoff&pf_rd_i=6308595031&pf_rd_m=A1K21FY43GMZF8&pf_rd_p=2c2b4d9e-f15e-4cf3-8e5c-acf68c668c41&pf_rd_r=80WR7NYVY11014AWK7F7&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_t=101&qid=1601263641&refinements=p_85%3A10440599031&rnid=10440598031&rps=1&s=electronics&sr=1-17', 'category': 'Mobile', 'destination_urls': ['/realme-Classic-Wired-Earphones-Microphone/dp/B08G28Z33M/ref=pd_sbs_353_1/259-4565151-3054316?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B08G28Z33M&pd_rd_r=b523e269-5b61-443f-8854-bbd8dc1da3d6&pd_rd_w=0fDHz&pd_rd_wg=YyvMm&pf_rd_p=00b53f5d-d1f8-4708-89df-2987ccce05ce&pf_rd_r=ANB1PHG28F6EY721MPBT&psc=1&refRID=ANB1PHG28F6EY721MPBT', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A04204951A8TLSXMO08MA&qualifier=1602310265&id=2672870058461606&widgetName=sp_detail&url=%2Fdp%2FB07D95R6M1%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB07D95R6M1%26pd_rd_w%3DYtXuI%26pf_rd_p%3D1801b34c-8af9-42b5-8961-11f124edc99b%26pd_rd_wg%3DYyvMm%26pf_rd_r%3DANB1PHG28F6EY721MPBT%26pd_rd_r%3Db523e269-5b61-443f-8854-bbd8dc1da3d6', '/Clavier-Carrying-Portable-Protection-Headphone/dp/B07T6F17YX/ref=pd_sim_353_1/259-4565151-3054316?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07T6F17YX&pd_rd_r=b523e269-5b61-443f-8854-bbd8dc1da3d6&pd_rd_w=alB0d&pd_rd_wg=YyvMm&pf_rd_p=cfbdc993-747f-4497-88ed-a04e039c6408&pf_rd_r=ANB1PHG28F6EY721MPBT&psc=1&refRID=ANB1PHG28F6EY721MPBT', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A0632259UUZ933D3SC12&qualifier=1602310264&id=980065216480429&widgetName=sp_detail2&url=%2Fdp%2FB08FN6155Q%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1']}, {'_id': {'$oid': '5f815873aaa28c53dfe2b479'}, 'description': 'Redmi Note 9 (Aqua Green, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - 48MP Quad Camera & Full HD+ Display', 'price': '₹11,999', 'rating': '4.2 out of 5 stars', 'review_count': '8,742', 'reviews': ['\\n  Dont buy.. after 10 to.15 mins gaming phone lagging too much\\n', '\\n  Good phoneDecent look and looks stylishCamera and battery quality are super goodGood phone in this range 👍But delivery service is not good\\n', \"\\n  Not good phone stopped working after some time so i didn't suggest you this...\\n\", \"\\n  Here my product review after usage of 2 week.Pros:Design and built quality - superb.Display - Smoothness and view is very impressiveFinger print sensor and face unlock working  perfect.Rear camera - Good as considering the price.Ram management and multitasking - Just ok.

This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless .

Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster.

However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide\\'s sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0\" with 1.12µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ｖｉｄｅｏ ｒｅｃｏｒｄｉｎｇUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren\\'t many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that\\'s pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can\\'t see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should.\\n', '\\n  Selfie Camera Not As Expected-Picture Quality Very Bad, Appearing Small Dots On Entire Face During And After Selfie Clicks.Rear Camera :Rear Camera Picture Quality Nice But Detailing Not good.\\n', '\\n  Very good phone powered with battery and performance at this Price .But the problem is the Camera clarity.I compared it with MI A3 48 MP camera with this and was very Disappointed...No other problems\\n', \"\\n  Phone Performance overroll good but charging speed is too slow it's take more time to charge my phone 35 to 100 percent charge on a 3 hours i am not satisfied.

My last phone was Mi A1, which had stock android. Can't understand why Xiaomi, oppo, etc spend money in developing these crappy skins.

First impression is ok ok. Phone case should have been given transparent. It comes in grey shade so overrides phone color. Observed little lags in some applications. First battery charge took 4 hours for 10 to 95. Phone which supports 22.5W charging only accepts 18W. Doesnt make sense. Since this is budget phone dont expect too much but atleast battery charging issue should be fixed.Note on Amazon Delivery - Considering the ongoing situation, I can undestand Amazon prefer for contactless delivery. But delivery person didnt call me at the time delivery. He directly handed my shipment to security. When I reached customer care, I was pointed that, I had received message and mail about delivery. But I was not satisfied with the answer, since I was expecting call from delivery person for some reason.

You will also see a rectangular-shape cut out on the rear side housing the camera bump along with the fingerprint scanner. LED flash is placed beside the camera system. To the right side of the phone are the volume control buttons along with the power button. The SIM card tray is placed at the left side. Redmi Note 9 offers 2+1 card slots -- one for microSD card and two for SIM card each.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 is equipped with 3.5mm headphone jack placed at the bottom edge. The phone comes with a USB Type-C charger. The charging port is also placed at the bottom along with speaker grills and a microphone. On the top edge of the phone is the IR blaster.  The smartphone features a 6.53-inch punch-hole display with 1080x2340 FHD+ resolution. The punch-hole housing the front camera is placed at the top-right corner, thus it hardly obstruct the viewing experience on Redmi Note 9. The display is a strong point of the phone. It provides sharp colours with adequate brightness. Viewing angles are good too.Despite its glossy back, the phone offers a firm grip. The smartphone feels sturdy and durable and can be easily used with a single hand.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 9: PerformanceRedmi Note 9 comes powered by MediaTek Helio G85 octa-core processor with a maximum frequency of 2.0GHz, a GPU frequency of 1000MHz, and up to 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM. There is a 4GB RAM variant of the phone as well. The handset comes in two storage options: 64GB and 128GB. The MediaTek processor can easily handle day-to-day usage without giving you much to complain about.Considering, Redmi Note 9 is a budget phone, our hopes were not much high about the speed and performance of the device. The loading speed of the apps was reasonably good. Switching between multiple apps was easy. Gaming experience too will not be a disappointment. However, there were heating issues with the device after prolonged gaming or long streaming hours. But again, that’s acceptable at the price point.  Xiaomi has packed Android 10 with a layer of MIUI 11 on the top in the Redmi Note 9 phone. As with other Xiaomi phones, this device too comes with much pre-installed bloatware. These include apps like the Mi Credit, Helo, Mi Community, Zili and more. Some of the apps have already been banned by the Indian government. One can always uninstall them as per their own choice. What struck us is that the phone suggests you download a few more apps even during the setup process. But that again is an individual’s choice to install or not.Moving on, the phone’s UI is typical of any Redmi phone. If you are using a Redmi phone, you may find it easy to use the phone simply because of the familiarity. Also, you get spam notifications on the device.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 comes with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and Face Unlock technology for security and privacy of the device. Both worked well for us. The unlocking speed with both these security features was acceptable and just to the phone’s price.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9: CameraIn continuation of the trend these days, Xiaomi has introduced a quad lens camera system at the back with the Redmi Note 9. The phone offers a 48MP primary rear camera paired with three other sensors- a wide-angle lens, a macro lens and a depth lens. Again, there is not much new about the camera app and its UI. However, the company has added a separate Documents mode to Redmi Note 9 which can be used to scan important documents and papers. Considering the CamScanner app is no longer available, this is an important addition.The 48MP camera does justice to the object being captured. It is able to retain details and true colours more or less. However, the noise creeps in when you use the wide-angle lens. The sensor offers 8MP Ultra wide sensor with 118-degree field-of-view.

I also complaint this at Amazon and thank fully they refunded me my money.SO WHAT\\'S THE ACTUAL PROBLEMI think that when we check the imei info of the mobile it is somehow by default written as xiaomi m2 pro and that device didn\\'t support volte so when they turned volte on it showed that this device doesn\\'t support volte.So now it\\'s your decision.\\n', \"\\n  I am writing this review after 22 daysFirst of all the battery lifeIt takes about 2 hrs to fully charge itWhen u charge for 💯 percent of battery it easily long for min of 1 day on high usageI used to attend online class for continuously for 7 hrs starting from 9 am morning to 4pm eveningIn between i use whatsapp and Instagram often and also used to play PUBG  for 1 hr in between break in evening after 4 i used to listen to music the @ 8 pm the battery will be nearly 15 percent..So battery life good .Next camera  quality of it is goodNext fro playing pubgIt works flawlessly in HD  graphics when went above i have very slight lagOtherwise it's goodDisplay quality is very goodAlso when continuously playing pubg i have abslight heating issue which is common in redmi phoneBut nonthat extentConclusion : worth for money in this money segment .\\n\", \"\\n  Pretty much impressed by the camera clarity.

First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\\n\", '\\n  3rd class front camera. 32 MP front camera n looks like 2mp front camera. In very disappointed  with this kind of front camera. Need refund.\\n', '\\n  Dear Amazon & samsung you have broke my trust, Lot of noise in images while capturing photos in low light.Rear Camera getting blur in low light.\\n', '\\n  Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone\\'s quality doesn\\'t meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.\\n', \"\\n  I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage.64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording.Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds.Face unlock very slow.Heat issue which charging and heavy usageFull charge takes more than 3 hrsWould not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phonego with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality\\n\", '\\n  The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I\\'m lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product.Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.However my only concern is \"dust\" and how it came there if its brand new.So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.\\n', '\\n  Software is no working.

First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note.2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version.3. PROS.(a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at.(b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge.(c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash.(d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs.(e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful.(f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you.(g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging.4. CONS.(a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger.(b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1.5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍\\n\", \"\\n  I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product.

It is a good Video viewing experience.2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad.3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing.4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average.5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App.6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox.I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc.Thanks.\\n', \"\\n  One of worst mobile and one of the worst brand.

Going to request a replacement.Update 3:Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality.

Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps.

One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself )2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation.3. SAR rating - lowest one4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery )Cons :1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet )2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great3. Not so great processorWho can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.\\n\", '\\n  I found the phone to be mediocre in performance.Pros:1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen.2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage.3. Camera: Good, but not excellent.Cons:1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised.2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better.3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity.4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.\\n', \"\\n  Delivery was fast, packing was good, phone started quite unusual that applications were not even downloading on wifi, later after a couple of restarts it's good now.

Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days)3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAMCons:1. Front Camera is not as good as expected2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️)3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex\\n', '\\n  The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screenIf you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colorsI am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few daysCamera pictures are goodLots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually\\n', '\\n  use front cem iam not happy\\n', \"\\n  Display quality is good.

When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara.During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendlyThe most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%......Design- Not at all attractive..

I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating.------------------------------------------------------Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin.Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.\\n\", \"\\n  Disappointed  with Samsung, after many year I decided  to back to Samsung but  truly disappointed.

You will be in difficult situation,what to do?My strong recommendation not to go with Samsung M31.\\n\", '\\n  Camara is too bad. Sound clarity is not at all good ... though it looks like a premium phone ,but when you started using it makes you feel that you bought a cheap quality product. Gets frequently stuck and restarts for no reason.\\n', \"\\n  Lets get straight to the ponit. If your main motive is to play graphic intensive games (pubg/cod/asphalt/etc.) then there is a back button for you on the top left. Though Samsung M31 is a very good phone, there are other phones in this price range which will just do better in gaming.But...Also read the rest• PERFORMANCEThe combination of M31 processor (Exynos9611) and it's operating system (One UI 2.0) will give you a level of performace where you'd think your device is a flagship phone. It is clean, fast, optimize, and just feels so premium in daily uses.• DISPLAYThe super Amoled display use in M31 and the display that Samsung used in thier flagship phones are same. It is just so eye pleasing and the colour production they are just amazing. You will not find any display equal to this in this price range.(If you dont mind the high refresh rate displays which does not have Amoled like M31)• BATTERY AND CHARGINGThe M31 got the highest amount of battery among all the phones that I've heard (including midrange and flagships). On many online reviews it's charging speed has been criticized by many reviewers. But after using it for a while I think they are kinda exaggerating. Because we barely let our phone battery die till we charge. In normal uses I charge when it is around 20-30% it gets fully charged within a hour and 45 minutes. Which is still surprisingly good considering the Battery size that we get.•CAMERACamera is the field in which the M31 shines amongst the other midrange competitors. The 64mp primary camera, the 8mp ultra wide, the 5mp depth sensor and the 5mp macro lens gives the perfect combination for the monster phone. Don't get fooled by the numbers in mega pixels because in the end it is how the device processes the pictures that matters the most. The Samsung M31 have particularly nailed those image processing.Meanwhile, the videos captured by these cameras are still above average they are not the best in this price range.*CONCLUSION*The Samsung M31 is one of the most overall balance phone in the midrange. In some devices when there is an upgrade in one field we needed to compromise with the other downgrade. Every phones have their pros and cons no matter what brand. But considering all these ups and downs M31 still makes a value for money purchase.Thank you..(If you have any question regardingthis device. You can always drop them on the comment)\\n\", '\\n  Dear Amazon Team,I have been delivered faulty product from UP.

Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces.

One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this.Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing.1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc2. LED flash for incoming calls3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc5.

I needed another phone but couldn't afford to get another expensive device after just losing one. When I read the specs for the M31 128GB (which seemed unreal) I decided to give it a shot. For the price, it's honestly a steal! Great battery life, awesome camera and pretty good aesthetic appeal too.What of course I'm disappointed in is that I've needed to reboot it several times due to the phone hanging or app failures and a couple of times it just rebooted on its own... The response is jerky at times (nothing in the league of the S series). But then, at this price, that's really not a fair comparison.So if you're looking for a monster that's pocket friendly - this is the BAAP. I would have just liked it slightly smaller in size so it fit pockets and arm bands easily... But that's me.\\n\", \"\\n  Sorry but this time Amazon and Samsung really disappointed me.I have bought samsung m30 and m30 S earlier from Amazon and it was really a Goood great deal.

It also has Dolby Atmos sound.The rear camera is phenomenal (see pics). Getting a 64 MP camera inThe AI is what makes it stand out and the colours really pop out beautifully. The selfie camera (32 MP) is also good it doesnt have a flash but the screen flash does the job.Played pes (1.6 GB football multiplayer game) on it and it works very well. I haven't faced any lags in it so far. And the samsung UI like the notification bar, icons and settings is also easy to use and gives a premium effect.So here are the pros and consPROS:- Price- Camera- Battery- Display- Storage and it also has a dedicated memory card slot.CONS:- Back design could have been better. But i use a separate cover so it doesn't make difference to me.- Charging could be fasterFinal thoughts- This phone is ideal for anyone looking for a good battery and camera in their phone. The price still astounds me and samsung has really outdone itself.\\n\", \"\\n  Very poor quality, phone touch stopped responding on few areas suddenly. Didn't expected this from Samsung. I am not able to use from a month.. :(Tried connecting customer service and they asked to go service center when it opens after lockdown. On asking whether my warranty period would be extended due to this, they completely denied.. I am feeling cheated now. :((Don't buy this phone !!\\n\", \"\\n  Samsung has created enough hype, got in many stars and YouTube reviewers to sing loud praises of this product. There is enough positive data out there, so I will not repeat that.This is undoubtedly one of the best mid-rangers out there. But with few glaring shortcomings. From minor to major flaws:First thing to note is the back panel, which is prone to scratches and smudges. Samsung could have provided a case or have made arrangements to ship both the device and some selection of cases together. I didn't see many. This phone needs a case. period.Second is the camera. while it is good, with heavy post processing to get the right results. You can reproduce some of the advertised samples with the help of a tripod. But day-to-day shots will be still at 80% mark. No complaints for the price paid though.Third and one of the worst offenders no one ever spoke of is the phone antenna. I have never seen a samsung with such pathetic antenna. Pair that with poor software. Signal is always 33% more attenuated compared to other phones: I have an older Nokia 8: M31 always has 2 bars less signal strength at the same place with same operator. Slips to 2G very easily. Calls are frequently cracking due to bad signal reception. And the software keeps forgetting my preferred network mode: Airtel on LTE auto and BSNL on 3G only. The moment I exit the setting app, it resets everything to LTE auto and the auto downgrade to 2G continues.If you work or live in a place with even 50% signal on your current phones, be warned that this phone will add to your woes by simply not connecting. Antenna design is not something new that had to be completely reinvented for this phone, nor does it involve very expensive materials. Yet Samsung has screwed up in one primary function: How will you watch FHD+ videos if signal and speeds are pathetic because someone screwed up a basic function?\\n\", \"\\n  Review after 2 days of useScreen - 2 good..animations and transition very good, I won't miss hype around 90hz refresh rateSamsung OS- one UI 2.0 is good but I personally don't like the home screen, using Lawnchair launcher for home screen and dock...Like other features of OneUI2.0Games- Cant say, I dont use mobile for gamingBattery- charged only once til now, so far so goodCamera- Love live focus by samsung..Boehner is applied to all faces in pic, daylight pics and Videos are awesome, yet to test night modeCamera after 10days- indoor and low light is below average and a let down by Samsung.This is my first Samsung Smartphone and I am glad I bought itOpinion after 10 days- reducing rating to 3stars\\n\", '\\n  M31 looks identical to the Galaxy M30s New Galaxy M31 with OneUI 2.0 on top of Android 106GB RAM and 64GB/128GB Only 1000 Rs is different.Pros:--------------M31 has 4 cameras on the back1-64-megapixel GW1 sensor LED flash2-8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens,3-5-megapixel depth sensor4-5-megapixel macro sensorMassive 6000mAh battery with 15W fast charging supportBig 6.4-inch displays With AMOLED displaysUSB Type-C port, and speaker at the bottom.The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock with face recognition.Fit Under the Budget.Cons:----------------Plastic Bodylow-light camera performanceStill Its a new couple of days only I will Update later about the overall performance.\\n', \"\\n  Poor camera and display quality. Its not a 64 MP camera it's  quality is like 8 MP camera. Flash is not working in 64 MP ratio.And Amazon is also not returning this item. Vivo gives more quality in this price range. Now a days Samsung is selling it's name only not quality. Don't buy this.\\n\", '\\n  Camera quality is not good as it mentioned in specification (64MP).Mobile phone gets hanged sometimes.Battery back up is good.Facilities and other fitures are not good as compared to other brand mobiles in same prize.\\n', \"\\n  There are lots of negative review which led me to confusion before buying this, but this phone is worth the price.Display- awesome, colors , touch rsponse...all good.Battery- long backup, even if u play games. Around 14 hrs display time (medium usage)Charging - a bit slow, takes 2 hrs from 25 to 100Camera- good color production,  decent picture quality (not a sony sensor, so don't expect that quality), macro is nice. Selfie (both angle) decent. Overall for day to day usage it's very good. But not for pro shooters.Processor- thought it would be the biggest drawback, but it is not, pubg and asphault runs well in smooth(not hdr)Overall i will recommend this phone to all who use phone for day to day usage(no hardcore gaming but big games with casual setting will run well), love to support made in india products.Thank you.\\n\", '\\n  I spend my first salary on the first day of the online launch and I am happy to have a good phone on the next day at my doorstep with all the features that I would like to on my phone.So here are Pros:6000 mAh Battery64MP Quad Rear camera32 MP Front Camera6GB RamFast chargingSmooth Touch displayPop-up view featureAndroid 104K video recordingFastest face unlock\\n', '\\n  Camera is not as expected. Its garunteed not 64MP the way it takes pictures. Ofcourse the colors in the pictures are awesome however, if we try to zoom even slightly it doesnt show clearly. Night mode is also not as expected it gives blurr images. I am disappointed with the camera as camera was the sole reason I took this phone. Front camera is as usual with full of beauty effects which I hate. Otherwise, speaking about its other features such as battery, looks and feel, Display, etc it is pretty well with this price. Although the plastic feels kinda cheap but its ok.\\n', '\\n  I don\\'t know this issue for all M31 devices or only my device. Camera quality is very very very bad.. If you do little zoom, you can see black lines are coming and going..If you record video, more than 30 minutes..getting message \"camera not responding message\"...Not happy with the audio\\n', \"\\n  I thought this may be great replacement of my S9 Plus and it proved me wrong...This is just an average phone with 64 mega pixel and that's it.....very poor performance if you install any apps more than 100 for a 128 GB phone.  The S9 plus can work seamlessly with 150 apps installed without any performance issues except the battery life.Pros:------>> no need to buy camera and use it as a camera.>> Good battery backup>> Selfie Camera is good with 32 mega pixel.Cons:------>> Just a toy phone for someone wants to play with camera.>> we need to look at the processor not just the camera quality.  I set up my office outlook and all other applications in this phone and it just gets struck ever 15 minutes and doesn't even close for 1 min almost.>> This phone with 128 GB is really waste as the processor can't handle that much memory.>> This may be good in videos quality but the poor options while capturing the camera (No Auto Focus).>> Worst face reading technology -- even after face unlock you still need to swipe up, and it sucks...!!!>> The charger that comes with this phone is a garbage it takes 3-4 hours to fully charge this phone.>> This phone is not water proof at all.  If you pour one drop on this phone, your screen touch will stop working.>> The speaker is very low and hardly you can hear when you put a hard case over the phone.>> My phone screen got damaged and not sure where can I get this replaced as there is no insurance for screen flickering issues.Conclusion:-------------An average model phone with 64 mp camera (I don't see any big difference with S9 plus camera features).  Needs a lot of improvement on the processor side and can't be compared with Snapdragon processors.\\n\", '\\n  1) From 0 to 100% taking more than 2 hours.2) Battery consuption is high due to default SAMSUNG apps which cannot be deleted and also reducing performance.3) Not possible to Delete NETFLIX4) Even if you download any app from Samsung store you have to upgrade it through Google Play Store, better to directly download latest updated version from Google Play Store directly5) Available RAM for use is only 3.2 GB due to too many unnecessary SAMSUNG APPS are not allowed to uninstall.It was my first and last mobile of NON STOCK ANDROID mobile, earlier used 5 stock android mobiles out of 6 gb RAM it provided 4.8 GB availablity and all non required apps can be deleted so purchasiñg \"Stock android\" mobile is only good option if want to purchase Android mobileDear Samsung - It was not your fault, I wasnt aware that purchasing NON Stock android will have additional mandatory apps of your company, Can you push OTA update for my device and make it stock android?\\n', '\\n  SAMSUNG LOVER WILL FELL UNHAPPY AFTER BUY M SERIES MOBILE SUCH AS I AM FEELING.SAMSUNG M SERIES HAVE VERY BAD & CHEAP MOBILE.I BOUGHT THIS PHONE WITHOUT THINKING, BUT AFTER USE I FOUND THAT THIS DEVICE DO NOT HAVESAMSUNG SECURE FOLDER, SAMSUNG PAY OR PAY MINI, KNOX SECURITY, SAMSUNG PASS, NFC ETC.

Specs are good enough for budget price of 17k.4,  Cam specs4.  Not to a pick a Chinese product.But friends i am telling you who are having above thoughts you make like M31 but dont go for it. Because here are con's :1. While speaking over the phone, Its going to hold even though there is no touch to screen while speaking.2. Even though i haven't enabled call recording, few calls are getting recorded automatically.3. Worst thing, If you upload a pick to Watsapp status your picture quality goes worst.4. For full charging it will take 3 hours. Not used my phone extensively it gave charging for 1.5 day.5. Vedio recording image stabilization - Worst.Then i started googling about unstability of this phone, There was an update for samsung M31 in April which made phone to unstable.

So we understand these things, there\\'s no such thing as \"gorilla vorilla\" it\\'s a normal mirror. If it falls and breaks then you\\'ll have to pay for this.\"I can\\'t believe Samsung has been making a fool of us all these years. Can anyone else confirm this \"insider\" info? Meanwhile, the rest of you should keep this in a bank locker.\\n', \"\\n  Purchased this phone on the 1st day of launch i.e. 5th March 2020; 12:00 PM. After using more than a week, reviewing the phone on 14th March 2020; 5:15 PM. I hope you will find it helpful.*Camera:Rear Camera has few mode/frames. Out of which it's fixed 3:4 (64 mp) has great picture quality. Other modes/frame like 3:4, 9:16, 1:1, full can capture good quality pics as long as you do not zoom it. Video quality is also good but could be better.Front camera 32 mp is also fine. You will get delicately balanced picture quality.* 6.4 inches phone feels bit large and heavy while handling and keeping in pockets.* Battery (6000mAH): It stood on its ground. Surely have high battery backup. Did few experiments and here's the result:--> Around 50 hrs on standby mode with normal use for calling and checking messages (Wifi was active during those hours and background apps were running)--> 11-12 hrs of continuous usage for gaming--> 18-20 hrs of continuous video playing over wifi (not sure for mobile network)Disclaimer: These hours may vary as per individual use and environment. I'm sharing the details as per my own usage.* Exynos 9611 Octa core processor: Samsung is surely working hard with providing improved versions of its processor. The processor speed with the combination of Android v10 is great. I didn't find any heating issue even while playing high end graphic games. The RAM wasn't even getting used completely. However, if we compare this processor with Snapdragon, I can say that this processor is equivalent to Snapdragon 700 series.* Face unlock and fingerprint sensor: Company claims that the phone has fast face unlock and fingerprint sensor. However, I didn't find that true. For face unlock, the phone takes 2-3 sec time to detect the face.* Phone comes with Dual SIM (nano+nano) facility but with dual standby. Both SIMs aren't active simultaneously.* Both Charging slot and 3.5mm jack for earphones are placed at same end (bottom side), which I personally didn't like (That is one of the reason I rate it 4 star).* There are other internal features as well which one person might like and another might not. Example: Wifi Calling support, Blue light filter, smart view, ultra data saving mode, Dulby Atmos, Dark Mode etc...--> Dulby Atmos function work while you plug in the ear-phones (I personally didn't find it that good. Sound quality seems similar)--> Personally love the Dark Mode.Overall, the Smartphone is great. If you want to purchase a smartphone within this range, you may go ahead with this one.\\n\", \"\\n  From the user of Samsung Guru 1200, Metro duos C3322, Mertro XL, Galaxy On5 Pro to this Galaxy M31 & going to use Note series after some months & as a Samsung fan I'm honestly writing this review. This is a Decent phone at this price. Most of the time the Fingerprint reader unable to unlock the phone. This type of camera quality isn't expected from 64MP, f1.8 camera sensor. Macro camera, selfie camera, wide angle camera okay. In this phone, you can't choose ringtone from external memory or even phone memory and Samsung should give the internet speed notification, daily usage on the notification bar like other mobile phone to compete in this type of small matter, without giving that Glance, Discover etc option. Samsung should change this from next update to become more popular like other phone. Touchscreen is too much sensitive but this sAMOLED screen is just superb, awesome and 6000mAh battery will give you a long lasting usage after one full charge. Otherwise it's an all in one phone.The new problem which I'm facing now(after using it 2 months) is, if the data connection is on with 1st SIM and at that time if any SMS comes to 2nd SIM then the data connection get lost fully until I active the airplane mode & then deactivate it. It makes a lot of problem during banking transactions with OTPs.\\n\", '\\n  First of all, my first review was deleted by amazon, saying its manipulating the context and feature of product..This is a review section so i can give my honest review but amazon is deleting it thats dumb.. If u dont need reviews than block it for all. Why would u only keep only positive reviews and delete any negative points????Here is the thing- battry is not uoto mark.. It drains quickly.. And it takes more than 2.5 hrs say 3 hrs as per my personal experience.Camera is good.Battery is a nightmare if u want to keep it charging after every 2 hrs than go ahead .and last time i gave 2 stars.. But u deleted the comment so this time take the 1 star for the product.. Coz its really a peice of shirt. You know twhat i mean 😂😂😂😆\\n', \"\\n  Gorilla glass 3Its very worst fregile product. Fall ones by 5 inch and broken glass.I have Samsung Galaxy m31 i buy before 2 months.  But till i full reset my phone after that my fast charging  not working. I used already  another charger and cable  but its not workin also. I used power off mode also but it's not working.  So friends  there is no support to how to do use fast charging.  Please don't buy Samsung M series. AND after 3 months NOW comes new update fast charging is worked. 16 jun 2020 .Thank You\\n\", \"\\n  The phone is very amazing it's more than expectation. I ordered black version with 6GB of ram and 128 GB space. Best smartphone in this segment price. The trump card  of this phone is camera. What a wide angle and selfie  captured by this phone amazingly good..  all the best feature you will get on this price.\\n\", '\\n  This is the Galaxy M31 review after a week use.Bought this phone to replace my existing iPhone SE after watching so many videos of tech reviews which are continuously bashing Apple for providing low specs mobiles. After a week, I realised that I made severe mistake by acknowledging their words. The 64 MP camera is nowhere near my 4 year old iPhone’s 12 MP camera. Macro camera is another joke in this package.Performance:  Galaxy M31 has ‘so called’ 6 GB RAM but works like 100MB RAM device. 3 GB RAM will always be occupied and you can’t do anything about that. Say what, you are free to use 3 GB RAM only. Even my Windows 10 OS use only 1.5 GB RAM. And even my older Moto E ( yes, Moto E) works better than this phone in scrolling through internet. About gaming, it’s bad joke. My 4 years old iPhone SE runs seamlessly even in 2GB RAM.Tech people always boast about Android that it’s customisable. What customisation would serve if your phone is not even working properly? You aren’t even allowed to uninstall Netflix and they keep talking about customisations.Battery life is pretty good though. At least they did good in this case. 6000mAh lives for 1.5 to 2 days in normal use.Another feature provided with this phone is heating. Just some normal activities will heat up your Galaxy M31 so much that you can pretty much use it as heater in winters. Not joking here.I bought 64 GB variant, and only 47 GB was usable. Android system is taking 13-14 GB in the system. Really?Overall, not happy with purchase. Waste of 16.5K with this garbage product.Samsung, you can so way better than this!!\\n', \"\\n  I have been using the phone for the past 2 month now. The battery life is a sham!! 6000mah does not even last for a day and the phone becomes very hot very easily, and the calls disconnect or the phone restarts at its will. The WiFi calling does not work at least 40% of the time!! It is filled with a ton of benefits but the main reason anyone would ever buy this phone is for the battery and that is not true as advertised. One WiFi video call of 2 hours drains at-least 40% of the battery!! My battery stays for only one day, I got better battery life with my old phone of 5000mah...could do almost 48 hours without any charge. Now I'm stuck with this!! Please test the battery and return it immediately if there is a fault, don't do what I did, which is 'I adjusted'!\\n\", \"\\n  Very bad product. There are so many issue.1. Heating during using the phone. Like camera phone calls in 2-5 mins.2. Poor front camera quality. Like 8 MP camera.3. Sound is also not good.4. Taking more than 3 hours to charge full. And 6000mah batter is giving one day backup.full fake.Totally fake phone by Samsung. Requesting Amazon to don't sell this kind of fake phone. Samsung  are fooling the amezon customer.Don't buy.\\n\", \"\\n  As consider price point galaxy m31 is very high in price because of the performance, camera quality, processor and design wise its very dull and boring in real life and also heatup very quickly when Playing games. And one more thing in galaxy m31 also have ads like redmi, realme, oppo and vivo. Samsung simply cheat you and looting you.I must said please don't waste your money on waste galaxy m31 because at this price you have very better option available in market. Samsung also leak and stole our data as like other companies so their is no difference between Chinese company and Samsung. If you not agree with me than just read carefully user agreement, terms and user policy of Samsung.\\n\", '\\n  Samsung Galaxy M31 smartphone runs on Android v10 (Q) operating system.

All the gimmicks while setting up the phone would make one feel happy about buying the phone. Now let's get to the tall claims by Samsung basis which one has spent 17K.First of all I received a phone which when switched on went directly to system reboot mode. That was the first shock! The others are described next.Finger print reader is slow at times and one has to place the finger a couple of times to unlock the phone.Battery Life is lower than a 3000mah. Yes, one would get a longer battery life out of this phone if left unused and that is precisely what it hasn't been purchased for.Camera Quality is bad, very bad. The pictures are so grainy and pixelated. Had a Moto G4 plus before this and the picture quality from the camera was awesome.Feel cheated by Samsung for palming off such poor quality device for INR 17K. I want a refund.Amazon, I am aware that this review will go through a review by your team. Please take note and help initiate a return and refund so that I can buy a better device worth its value. Tganks!\\n\", \"\\n  Awesome  screen .Awesome battery  .Awesome  cameras .Specially  ... one UI 2.0 of Samsung  is superb. I used Samsung  Galaxy  alot but for 2-3yrs i was on moto and others ... but being  back to Samsung ... it's  worth it .Go for it ... the screen is just min blowing  at this price . No one can beat it .Also .. I don't  play any games ... but i read alot and watch plenty of movies ...but being  an experienced  smartphone  user i can tell ... it can run any game without  lag .. with 6 gb + exynos 9611 processors (if I'm  ri8) . Same as A51 which cost 24k .Just go for it .1 thing is plastic body ... but body is also very good ... not like previous  plastic  Samsung  ... it's  glossy ... but any way we are gonna use back case  ... so it doesn't matter  anyway .1 thing - Biometric  take some time to get use to i guess.It's  a large device ... side fingerprint  would have been best .And face unlock  take some time ..... face unlock is not that good i would say . But may be due to extra security  .. we have to make sure of correct  angle and light  .\\n\", \"\\n  So this is my edit review after using not more than 3months.. It has discolouration issue.. No any external force applied neither contact of water.. It happend when my phone's battery death and I plugged in with charger after then I putted off and I saw discolouration sudden..It started right bottom to top with pink and purple shade nd quickly spread overall display..And when I visited service center they directly denied to repair as told that it's not under in warranty.... Nd I'll have to bear that cost with Rs of 5000 to 6000 for change the display.. When I already spent 17000 Rs. to purchased new phone..DISGUSTING....And I believe that everyone keep their phone safely when atleast phone is new and expensive..I feel just regret about my decision and mistake I made to purchased this worst compny phone..But I surprised how Samsung play the scam game with their valuable customersNow I believe that Samsung is just fraud and fake and it's scam nd make fool to their customers in name of the warranty.I recommend to all Amazon buddies pls pls pls 🙏 don't go with Samsung Phone if you don't wanna waste your hard earn and valuable money....\\n\", '\\n  I used to be a Samsung customer long back but had switched to Chinese brands which have dominated the market for quite some time now. It is very refreshing to see Samsung again giving competition to these brands in 15-20k segment.This phone is certainly a testimony to the resurgence of Samsung in this price bracket.Now coming to the phone :Pros :-1. Battery : This has to be the single largest plus point of this phone. At 6000mah, Its battery is a monster and it was the prime reason i bought this model rather than the other chinese brands which barely last a day on a full recharge. On the other hand, this battery easily lasts 1.5 - 2 days in normal usage and more than a day in heavy usage.2. Dedicated memory slot (2+1) : This is another big plus of this model that you get a dedicated slot for memory card.3. Screen Quality - It is FHD+ screen with nice and smooth colors. There is no lag and it feels fluidic. Where it scores over other brands is that Samsung offers Super Amoled screen whereas other brands have LCD capacitive touch screen. Though there is not a huge difference between the two but you do get a premium feel while using this one.4. Camera - Again it is good at 64mp and the zoom out feature works like a charm. Also, there is no lag whatsoever while clicking heavy pics at full resolution. Front facing camera is good as well and stands at 32mp. No lag in clicking front photos as well.5. Size : It is not that huge and you can use it with a single hand.6. Memory : 6gb Ram and 128 gb memory is more than sufficient. Plus, the dedicated memory slot is a huge add-on.Other conviniences include - Type C charging port and fast charging support and 3.5mm audio jack.Now coming to the cons. Not many but a couple i definitely noticed :1. Fingerprint Sensor : It is not just bad but very bad (and I mean it). Very unresponsive and erratic. I mean you have to wait for a couple of seconds for it to respond after placing your finger. And it may sometimes glitch as well. So, you need to retry.2. Charging cable : Extremely short length at 1 feet or so which renders it quite useless. Length is very insufficient.3. Charger : It is a standard 5v-2A charger. They could have provides a bigger one given that phone supports quick charging.Overall if you take a look at the price (15k) , it is an awesome buy. Apart from the Fingerprint sensor, I found everything in the phone to be top-notch. The specs at this price might be arguably comparable to other phones in this range but the battery backup makes buying this phone a no-brainer. Would definitely recommend this anytime :)\\n', \"\\n  Battery is very poor. It is draining at a rate of 6% per hour. I didn't expect such a poor product from samsung. Moreover, while charging for even half n hour phone heated up. It restarted by it's own after following troubleshoot procedure also.\\n\", \"\\n  I was using Samsung J2 earlier,  excellent phone,  later shifted to moto X4....after long time switching again to Samsung after hearing the success of M30s. Little disappointed. It's an average mobile phone.1.The finish of the phone is below average. If we use this mobile without back cover,  please will judge that this guy is using cheap Mobile,  I am covering it up with spigen cover now. It is not even like Samsung J2 mobile. Poor plastic.(ABS).2. CAMERA,  I use to take lot of mobile photographs  it's my hobby,  I don't see any difference in this megapixel and 3 or 4 camera's....if you are better cameraman, single camera is enough,  since it is with 4 camera we try to take different pictures,  camera okay. Lot of night in low light. Macro is 5 MP, no clear picture....3. Reception of Mobil signal, I felt slightly weak,  when I compare with motoX4, I was using it for nearly 2 years, now with M31s, I am not getting proper data connectivity inside home. Further I have to check...4. Mobile phone is mobile slightly heating up, not like mi,  but it is not like earlier Samsung.5. Battery it mega but last for one complete day, there is ko need to search charger in the evening,  but we need to charge it in the night, the charging time is long since the battery 6000mah. There will be possibilities of partial charging of battery, which may reduce the life of battery.Samsung could have done better, looks like urgently cooked\\n\", \"\\n  1.Good Camera but produces Noise in Indoor Lighting Conditions Could be Fixable through an OTA Update.2.Very Good Battery Life.3.Good Display but lacks HDR 10 support.4.Processor Gives Average performance compare to Qualcomm Snapdragon Processors but its sufficient for Normal People Who don't play Heavy Graphics Related Games.5.Physical Fingerprint Scanner is Quite Fast But An In Display Fingerprint Scanner Would Give Better Experience On This Smartphone.6.Software on this device is Smooth like a Butter and Packs Some Really Good Features but Real-time Network Speed Option Should Have Been Provided For Better Experience On This Device.Maybe Samsung Could provide this feature thought OTA Update Later On.7.This Phone Comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 but They should Provided Corning Gorilla glass 5 as other brands are providing in this price range.\\n\", \"\\n  Pros:1.

Would be great if they provide stereo speakers like in the NokiasCons:1. Primary Camera is decent but not great. 64 MP is just a number on paper. My 16 MP LG V20 camera takes better photos.2.

It does not look like Samsung.The overall experience is not at all good. Other phones in the range give better quality.\\n', \"\\n  Purchased Samsung M31 on sale date and got delivered the very next day. As soon as i opened  the box i was disappointed  as there is no Screen protector or Mobile case available. Box has only mobile phone , type c cable and charger only. Phone was charged to 73%.Now , i have been using it for past few days and i have mixed reviews about it.Display of this phone is very good and one can easily differentiate between anyother company and samung's super Amoled.Camera seems to be okayish.. it's  not that great but UI of samsung is very smooth.Batterylife is also decent compared to 6000mah.My opinion is it will be a decent buy for 15k but dont expect too much from it.\\n\", '\\n  \\xa0Live focus Camera is too goodBattery is great which lasts for a day.Display is nice and Bigger great for watching video and playing games.Fingerprint scanner is little bit slow.Face detection also slow.But in 16 k it is value for money.\\n', \"\\n  I saved money for 5 months and bought this phone about 25 days ago. First thing is you cant replace it after these days and now it is getting restarted in-between  i am working on it. Not just that , it does not turn on but only the samsung logo shows for 1-2 hours. Now you cant do anything. I went to service center . They kept this phone for 3 days and did nothing . They said to me to pick up my phone after all the data has been deleted and phone's has been reset . And the very next day , here I am with this same problem . I am regretting a lot with samsung .

My old phone get charged quickly rather than this.When i tried to reach customer care toll free, there is no response from them saying \"Limited staff\". Think before buying this model twice.\\n', '\\n  Very very disappointed about the quality of the product...used only for 10 days...then a black spot started appearing in the back camera..visited Samsung Garia service centre.They denied to replace the product as I have purchased it online..However they took my complain and advised that they will change the camera but that is a time consuming matter.really disappointed after investing hard earned money in Samsung...very very poor quality product..\\n', '\\n  Bought phone on May 21 and Screen broke on June 21. Customer care while e-mailed said that it is covered under warranty- Service Centre denied to replace screen, asking for 5k Plus taxes. Why should anyone buy a product that has NO GUARANTEE? Is this the service of the product?\\n', '\\n  NEVER BUY SAMSUNG. HORRIBLE PHONE.If you\\'re a power user. 5+hre of screen time.

This happens on all apps incl youtube, netflix, amazon prime, including videos I have been sent via WhatsApp. b) there is no sound on the phone at all - nothing when I play music, it doesn't ring when someone calls me, and even though i can pick up the call, I can't hear the other person's voice and they cant hear mine ATTEMPTED FIXES THAT DID NOT WORK1. Restart multiple times2. Reset app preferences3. Play with Dolby settings (restore to default, turn off/on)4. Wipe cache preferences using volume up/down buttons then rebooting5. Adjusting all the volume settings to make sure nothing was muted6. Turn phone on on safe mode to ensure it wasnt the apps that were buggy (and played a video I had stored on my phone but same issue)\\n\", '\\n  Initial reviewPerformance  of the phone is slow for normal day to day activities.  You can lag in opening  apps like outlook, gmail and any other  day to day apps. Some items you can see lag in animation. I have changed setting to use less animation after that also seeing  the performance lags. No worth for amount.  The reason for performance  is Samsung uses their own processor  which slow.After one week of usageif the phone batter down to 20%, then phone will go to completely not usable state. Finally i put charge and re-started the phone to make it work.Camera is good. Battery stands for 1.5 days for normal usage. Worst performance phone for day of day use.Finally, here is the root of the problem. This mobile has ghost touching problem. Totally useless now.\\n', \"\\n  Battery life is better than my previous phone which was a 4000MAh. I am yet to rigorously test it through gaming and continuous wifi or data being on.Camera on the front does a horrible job. Shame on Samsung that they name it a 32Mp camera. The back camera does a decent job but not upto the expectation of a quad camera set with 64Mp.RAM is pretty good and I feel the phone has no lag and it doesn't hang.Speaker voice quality is average and could be  better.The body is extremely disappointing as it's a fingerprint magnet and Samsung doesn't give you a back cover at least.Facial recognition takes a lot of timeConclusion: can't expect any better than this on the price range.However, samsung and Amazon have blown the hype out of proportion especially when they know that business value is lesser when competing with the likes of Xiaomi or Vivo or Realme\\n\", '\\n  Fair review after one week of usage:Pros: 1. The display quality and size is quite very nice. The cover i would suggest is Spigen Hybrid case for a complete protection.2. The fingerprint sensor is fast.3. The latest android 10 provides it with vast features.4. The trending USB Type C port is latest compared to other lower range samsung phones.5. The ocean blue colour makes a premium feel in hand.6. Battery life is quite very good.7. The expandable storage through micro sd is quite appreciable.8. The processor is fast and good for gaming.9. It competes with other samsung phones and is a good replacement for J series in terms of features, speed, processor and ram.Cons: 1. No back cover and earphones are provided by samsung with this phone which isn’t expected. Though all the lower range phones of other brands have these basic things.2. The back panel is polymide plastic which could have been a glass one to give it a premium feel like in Redmi note 8 Pro which too has almost the same price tag.3. The face unlock does not always recognise the face and have to work with fingerprint or other methods of unlock.4. The display seems to be fragile and prone to scratches and cracks if hybrid case and tampered is not used.5. The charging is a bit slow.6. The phone lags sometimes while unlocking through lock screen which isn’t expected with this processor and android version.7. The sound output could have been more.8. The fingerprint sensor is located too above on the back panel.9. The camera quality is average and could have been much better as compared to other brands with this price.The phone could have been a beast if these features were improved by samsung. I will conclude by saying, Its a very good phone in this price tag if these cons does not matter your day to day usage. Though its the best phone in all the lower range series of samsung.\\n', \"\\n  The WORST phone you can get in this range, front camera pics quality is so worst that it looks like an oil paint job with all smudged, NO SHARPNESS at all. The curve of display is so round it doesn't even  feel like a rounded rectangle, it's an OVAL. EVERTHING IS PLASTIC, The software processing, image processing, performance processing  is just bad, no its WORST. The game booster which is provided doesn't  seems like its boosting anything than consumption of battery. A LOT OF HEAT IS GENERATED in usage of 1 hour even while doing normal tasks.In conclusion, even if someone  is giving  this SAMSUNG M31 for free DON'T BUY IT.  M31 is just a hoax of a specs and nothing more, the worst of all. This was my first samsung phone, gone with the brand's name and it's simply disappointing,NEVER GONNA BUY ANOTHER  SAMSUNG PRODUCTNow with this AMAZON POLICY OF NOT REFUNDING, feels like the most regrettable decision of the year, feels like mental torture spending 17K for this M31. SIMPLY WORST. Seriously  need my money back, NEED REFUND for this product, WORST PRODUCT in every aspect.\\n\", \"\\n  UPDATE: I hate this phone... how can a phone just crash and reboot lying on the table without being used? This *NEVER* happened with my Motorola G5 Plus!======================================================================================Looks surprisingly thin. But not great. Samsung UI is ok, but not great. Lots of bloatware.. some I could uninstall, but some I couldn't. Installed Microsoft Launcher over the Samsung UI.Took some photos.. it didn't stand out. Though I need to take more photos to judge.The one thing which I absolutely HATE is the position of the single speaker.... it's just where I usually place my right pinky finger to hold up the phone. And this drowns out the sound of the video. It's very important to buy a phone with dual speakers.. preferably one that is at the top.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Updated after more than a month of usage:- The phone heats up during charging.- It has crashed and rebooted 2-3 times while in the middle of something.- Low light videos are TERRIBLE.- Compass calibration keeps going wrong. Every time I have to use it, I need to re-calibrate it.- Speaker is not good at all. Part of the reason is the placement. My 3 year old Moto G5 Plus was much better.I wish I had bought the Redmi Note 9 Pro :(\\n\", '\\n  Editing the review since camera results are very poor. Too much smudges and noises and looks like either faulty product or incorrect advertisement regarding camera specs.Well crafted product, but very poor camera qualityPros -good picture qualityNice displayBiometrics is fasterBlue color on the back looks classyGood batter lifeCons-Given the specifications found the performance a bit lackingOverall a good phone for the given price range\\n', '\\n  This phone is great with battery backup and picture quality but within 8 days the phone got in bootloop as sson as I got a new update and I did it. This is not even starting now.\\n', \"\\n  Do not buy this phone.Its display quality is very bad. My one month old Galaxy M31 phone developed crack in display. It does not have any physical damage from outside. Now Samsung service center is taking Rs. 5000 to repair it. Just one month back I have purchased it and it is under warranty, but they are charging money to repair it.Today I called Samsung Service Center, but nobody is picking up phone. More than 10 days have passed, they have taken my phone but no status update from them.Just now (21 Sept 2020) I received a call from Samsung, they informed me that spare parts is not available for this M31 model, so they will refund (coupon) me the purchase price by deducting Rs.5200 for the defective display.My question to Amazon and Samsung is that how you can tell that replacement spare is not available for this newly lunched phone? Just 2 months back this phone was launched.So, requesting Amazon and Samsung to refund full purchase price of the phone and also compensesation. No coupon will be accepted, transfer in my bank account.When you are selling any products, you are bound to provide spare part support upto it's end-of-life/support date. Did you mean EOL/EOS reached in just 2 months?\\n\", '\\n  Hangs up in 2 months. Had to loose entire Data. Samsung service centres is always full with atleast 100 people in line. That speaks about the quality . Had similar experience in the past. Trusted Samsung for second time in vain. Never Buy Samsung Products. within 2 months touch not working and hangs up frequently.\\n', \"\\n  \\xa0The Amazon tamper proof packaging & timely delivery is always worth a thumbs up.The product was delivered without any issue, but after unboxing, when I wanted to switch it on, it just wouldn't. I was expecting the phone to have some juice, at least 20-30% battery, but it was not so. When I connected it to the charger, the battery level was 0%. So I charged to 20% and then switched it on..and it actually started in the recovery mode, instead of normal boot. And that was a surprise..but then I could boot it normally.After this initial scare, the setup was normal and smooth.I like the look & feel of the product, and as compared to my earlier Moto One Power, it is way lighter even with a 6000 mah battery. But I do have a feeling, Snapdragon is a bit smoother than Exynos.Overall for me, after two days of usage, I am satisfied with the performance. The camera output, both front & rear, are really good, though I have not used all the modes yet.For me, the most useful features are the in-built call recording facility and the always on feature (I though always on was only available with Motorola).In short, I would say, it is a value for money device.I purchased the phone in March 2020, and by end of July 2020, I have received 2 security and feature updates.I have used the camera in the last 5 months. The results are very satisfactory. There may be some limitations in low light photography, but with a little tweaking, you get good results.\\n\", \"\\n  Before buying this phone, I had some doubt but after using this for almost one month, I am 💯 percent sure to say that, Samsung mid range phones are shit,Front camera quality is as bad as VGA one,Rear camera: always struggles to focus on close clicks, this phone has 64 MP camera but even my 16 MP phone camera perform far better, I can share the pics for comparison,Battery: this phone comes with 6000 battery but works as 4500 battery back up, maximum 12 hours, and the slow charging add more dimerit to it,Display: good,Performance: bad, very very bad, I don't know if my phone has some problem or Samsung is just proving it's  legacy of bad performaing mid range phones, this phone starts lagging while opening very normal apps, like WhatsApp, and YouTube, in have to say that m31 is  1.5 second slow in opening any app in comparison with my 4 GB RAM  cell phone.Design: does not feel sleek and premium in hand due to plastic body, but we could take that bulky design if battery works as expected because it has 6000 mah battery in it, but battery performance of this phone is simply bad.Sorry Samsung for this critical and negative review, but I have to say that you need to work on your midrange phones as well,\\n\", '\\n  Well I bought this phone after listening to all the appraisal its getting around.I bought a 6 GB Variant with 128 GB internal storage.The day it came it was fineWorking fineNow its.been about a month i have been using it..My Reviews for camera .... CAMERA QUALITY IS JUST FINE but the features given like AR DOODLE etc are amazing...BATTERY LIFE IS ABOUT 1 AND A HALF DAY of normal usageGestures are amazingPROCESSOR is kinda slow which leads to lagging sometimes especially when using AR Doodle and Of course during PUBG .. Normal Heating Issue not that big of a problemThere is a slight network problem with this phone as i compared it with my 2 friends phonesOverall the processor could have been much betterOther than processor( which is most important) everything else is upto the mark\\n', '\\n  Its OS Software got crashed in first update build release and it happened to all the M31 devices\\n', \"\\n  As I waited for a really long time to buy my Samsung galaxy phone, I am pretty disappointed with the performance of this phone.The camera quality and features are fine . But the fingerprint reader asks for so many attempts.Major issue with this phone is that it keeps restarting for no reason. That too 3 to 4 times a day !Intially I thought it needs an update and might work fine after that but that didn't work too.It's not very pleasing when it restarts in the middle of some important work you trying to finish.I have been using this phone for a month now but it has not been working upto my expectations.Sorry but not happy with my purchase.\\n\", '\\n  Dont buy samsung phones, Only gud for display clearity otherwise worst to but.Also cant return in amazon. within 2 days i tried to cantact amazon Customer service but cant reach them after reach them they said cant do return or replace so better go and buy any show rooms its better,\\n', '\\n  I ordered this phone and received on time. Thanks to Amazon. But once I opened the packet, the box was sealed, but the phone looked to be used already like may be for 1-2 days. There was a little scratch on the side of the phone, many applications weren’t working properly on the phone (ex: YouTube, Spotify), but eventually YouTube was fine but Spotify still has problem. I thought it to be problem of software, I reset the phone but nothing helped. Amid lockdown, I made peace with the phone but the just on the second day I was having problem with phone like my voice to the other person on calls was distorted and the other time the other person’s voice to me was distorted. I called amazon, twice thrice, but they suggested to diagnose the problem through their so called smart check application and my bad luck, and it didn’t show any problem. And for scratches, the amazon guys asked me to send photos but I don’t have DSLR to capture those small scratches (poor me). I ended up being denied for replacement or refund for the phone.I feel I am cheated on this particular product, I have invested rs. 15999 for a not reliable phone in my hand. It may stop working any time.Poor experience with amazon as well as the Samsung galaxy m31.I don’t even want to keep this phone, It gave me that bad experience in just 2 days of using it. But amazon is not supporting at all.\\n', \"\\n  Worst phone ever bought, don't  buy, charging slow, heating issues,  phone  gets heated in one small call, I will  return it,...\\n\", '\\n  Most disgusting service from Amazon & Samsung ever. Received a defected Mobile which had issues with its touchscreen. Replacing the phone is such a pain in the wrong place. First they ask you to download a stupid app to run testing which takes incorrect tests. I have problem with my touchscreen & they test the fingerprint sensor & give a result stating that all is good. Secondly I cannot contact any customer care agent as no one is available at this point of time. Customers are left to fend for themselves. \"Atmanirbhar\" is taken to a whole new level by Amazon!!! Utterly DisgustingPlease sort this out Amazon before your customers shift to other online apps.Samsung, Where has your quality gone? Do you only focus on expensive phones? One Plus & other brands have already started eating up your market share.. please act wisely if you don\\'t want to share your fate with Nokia.\\n', \"\\n  The mobile is a typical Samsung phone nothing special. The only attraction is quad camera and that too is not good, picture quality is like 8 MP camera. I exchanged my Vivo V9 with it and now i'm regretting it. Vivo V9 was far better than M31. If you are going by smart look and quad camera than i am sure this phone will disappoint you.\\n\", \"\\n  Totally flop phone,worst experience of my life to buy this mobile.After 15 days of purchase camera fail,always hanging problem.Now service center tell mother board and camera of this phone require to change.I feel cheated,I don't no whom to blame-AMAZON/SELLER/SAMSUNG.But my suggestion is never brought this M31.After spending a huge amount now I am running towards SERVICE CENTRE and there is a huge waiting during this pandemic and as usual server problems.Now today my phone is submitted and may be in 3-5days its problem solved.\\n\", '\\n  Bought this phone.  Received in time.  delivery is good.  Product is very very bad.  Plan to exchange it even for china mobiles.  I bought this mobile as my friend is happily using M30 for 2yrs.  I thought M 31 will be better than M30.1.  Audio quality is very very bad -  Not able to hear even when speaker is on with max volume and all equalizer settings.  All possible solutions available on line were tried in vain.2.  Frequently hangs even for a simple task like calling!  Then we have to press the power key to switch off and switch on -  this happened 4-5 times in 10 daysI dont feel like using a new mobile.  Not worth for 20,000.  I am planning to exchange it.\\n', \"\\n  I ordered the phone on June 1, which was delivered on June 5. I tried to start the phone. It didn't. I put it in the charger. No light. Nothing. Phone was completely dead. Same day I tried to put request Amazon replace/ refund section. Now here comes the worst part. It does not allow you to refund/ replace. Rather, it asks you to talk to customer service. However, there is no one in customer service to answer your phone. I tried to call directly at Amazon 1800 number. It does not connect.\\n\", '\\n  I bought this phone for my dad and Samsung is known for the durability plus 6000 mah battery is the highlight of this phone so it has long battery life also camera quality is good too.

It cost me 15,999 rupees.Literally shocked to see the Indian sim card only labeled on box.Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic. They said they cannot write everything about product.Product description is based on what features they want to show to customer. As it is a electronic item so there is no return possible, only replacement option is available if there is any fault in the product and cannot do anything more.They are not ready to accept the fact that they are hiding such a important information that this phone cannot be used outside India.Learnt my lesson and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in future.They are only good enough for groceries and small items.\\n', \"\\n  I am a tech guy and this review is genuine.

Touch is better than other mobiles compared to Oppo or MIComing to negative pointsall reviews almost fake regarding battery...they just really bluffed..6000 mah battery is not even coming for 2 full days..I used data for around 18 hrs but still it got drained fast.When charged the mobile it taking around 4 hrs to get complete charge from 0 to 100 percentage  but mobile is getting heated a lot..didn't expect this from Samsung at all.Loud speaker is not so efficient.Normal sound is goodAs its SAMOLED the picture or video quality is good..eyes r not strained\\n\", \"\\n  I have used Redmi mobiles for the past 3 years. I just wanted to change to Samsung for a change of experience. And you know what, it's turned out to be a good decision. Samsung Galaxy is an absolute beast. It looks elegant and operates smoothly with quite a lot of good quality features. I am enjoying using this mobile.Pros:* camera: video and image quality and available modes are too good at this price. It's good to have a 64MP camera. It works well in night light also.* Battery life is good.* No heating issues found while using and charging, unlike redmi mobiles.* No need of unnecessary mandatory apps installation like in redmi.* I feel like this mobiles  GUI is amazing and better than Redmi mobiles GUI (maybe because I got bored using redmi mobiles??).* Dolby sound system is too good. You can feel the difference if you compare audio quality with other mobile phones audio.* Smart switch app from Samsung helps to copy all the data from your previous mobile to this one. It's a good feature.* This mobile operates so smoothly.*Amoled display is amazing.Cons:* Face unlock system sometimes fails in darkness. Samsung should have worked on this feature pre-release. But it works fine in daylight.Overall a good experience and recommended product.Just a suggestion, if you are buying this mobile please spend 500 more bucks and buy Spigen back cover, mobile looks elegant with it. You will love your mobile more. Dont go for cheap quality back covers. You will regret it later.Update: After using it for 1 month, I have found that the internet speed is bit low when compared to other mobiles and sometimes internet disconnects automatically for some seconds.\\n\", \"\\n  The phone is overall good but have some problems such as camera doesn't  have autofocus.

Shame on you Samsung .\\n\", \"\\n  Phone is very slow because of the custom OS of Samsung, press lock button and it takes half a second to lock the screen, gets hanged too, not worth the price. Battery takes long to charge. Compared to other smartphone in the same price range, it's not worth buying unless you want phone with long battery life and the brand name.\\n\", '\\n  I have very disgusting experience with samsung. Im totaly dissatisfied with samsung m 31 series. I could only use for 3 days with smoothly. I dont know how why the product fail to accept my finger print and security pattern.  On next morning when i tired my fingerprint pattern were functioning properly aftr few minutes the same problem arise out of nowher. I have given my phone to Samsung store for repairing i hope it will resolve the issue..\\n', '\\n  I am a star maker user, my new mobile m31 is not supported for star maker singing, singing time Eco and others problem. I am already using m20 model of Samsung, but there was no problem.  But it has.  The purpose of taking my new mobile was in vain.  Please take necessary steps to support it in Star Maker.  please\\n', \"\\n  Worst phone ever I bought. I ordered the phone in 1st day of lunch. I got timely delivery but  After using for 29 days phone got hang up while updating software. Now phone is locked for more than 2days in a screen showing AVB error . I tried to restart phone many time but still showing same . Even I let the phone to get switch off by itself after consumption of battery still showing same while charging.Now I can't return it because they say return period were till 27th march. Lockdown nation wide still on can't go to Samsung care centre. I'm giving those stars because I don't have any option for zero.I don't understand what should I do.\\n\", \"\\n  Overall phone hardware is great. Amazing display, good camera features, awesome battery life and sturdy to hold.  The only downside is it doesn't support 4G+ aka carrier aggregation. Owing to this,  unless you have full tower,  the voice would break and data speed would go down! The hardware supports this feature but Samsung has not activated th CA feature. Even my two year old moto had this! This is turning out a dud for me especially for indoor coverage with work from home.  If I would have known this earlier I wouldn't have brought this phone :(  please do something about this!!\\n\", \"\\n  I bought 2 phones 10 days back. Biggest problem is from day 1, in both mobiles every now and then signal drops completely and I need to restart the phone to get signal back. I can't even make calls forget internet.When I searched about this in net and samsung members app, it was shocking that many phones have this problem. Kindly know this before purchasing M31. I did all that was suggested by samsung but nothing worked. Now I have to waste time going to service center.Another shocking fact is non of the reviews have pointed this problem where on the internet there are many people affected.If this is not sorted, I will sue samsung!\\n\", \"\\n  Received the phone 20 days back. After a long gap I am back to Samsung Brand and I must say the phone is awesome almost in all departments. The performance of 6GB/128 GB handset is definitely above the mark, ergonomically designed phone fits into the palm well , hence its a pleasure to hold the phone. The camera quality is good, ease of using, navigation is extremely user friendly and the  finger print sensor is good, not yet explored face recognition feature. Most of the important apps are pre-installed hence its again a plus point and more importantly Microsoft tools are re pre-installed, Just one draw back which I  found in the phone as of now is the app lock facility is not available need to install a separate app from the play store, this should have given as a preinstalled feature.My verdict is go for the phone its an awesome piece not from china so that's another satisfaction of holding this handset.\\n\", '\\n  Overall Rating:Camera 5/5Performances 5/5Display 5/5 - Super  Amoled DisplayBattery 5/5- 6000 MahPhone look 4/5User interface 5/5 - New Samsung One UI 2 is awesomeSound 5/5 - Dolby atmos Enhanced very much sound effect on Headset.Pros:1. The camera is up to the mark. No one Compete Samsung in mid Range Phone as Samsung has very powerful camera Software.2.It looks stunning high-end category.3.The battery is very powerful.4. Fast charging.5. Got OS update yesterday- Feb Security Patch included.Cons:1. Must be given some back cover in the Box.2. No headset included in the box.3. Earphone slot is given at a downside which makes it difficult to handle the phone.\\n', \"\\n  Worst phone ever i purchased in my life. First Time I was fool,only by his camera I was buy this phone. But camera quality is very poor. There is problem in Network also some time internet will not work properly. But when insert sim on my other handset I net will gave the very decent speed. I'm using this phone from 6months. But trust me this phone is horrible. And now there is no any option if I buy other handset by exchanging this. When go to exchange of the phone but there not available this phone in list. I need my money take your phone 😭\\n\", \"\\n  Rs 16999 for M31, It's worst product in this price segment.Camera quality is not better than vivo 21 mp, however Samsung is claiming 60 mp, which is Myth.Battery last in 1-9 hours. It takes around 3.5 hours to charge the battery fully (Samsung claim 2.5 hours)Its processor is quite slow, not getting required internet speed.I found 2 folds decrease in internet speed with this model.Touch is poor, you will find difficulty even in the slide to pick calls.Phone is getting hot even during calling and very very hot while on chargingIts buttons (power and volume) are getting pressed autonomously even without mobile coversI recommend you to never purchase such poor performance mobile phone. Please do not buy.\\n\", '\\n  I will not recommend this product to anyone due to the following facts:1. Exynos 9611, which is a 10 nm processor, produces so much lagg.2. 6000 mah battery is just a gimmick. It is also not comparable with even 4000 mah battery of other brands. It does not even last for a single day with moderate usage i.e. surfing with wifi connectivity (no gaming or watching videos).3. 64 mega pixel camera is another gimmick. No detailing is there. Capture is very much grainy. Pixel is also visible.4. Build quality is just not bearable. It gives feel similar to 7-8k phone. Cheap plastic is used in the back.5. Charging time is horrible. Near about 2.5 hours for full charge. It gives feel of black and white time!!I tried several times to contact Amazon technical team but they are not responding. Hopeless!!\\n', \"\\n  I brought it on the first day(March 5) it was released and seems good but after software upgradation it went for error.You cannot switch on/off your mobile...Ot will show an error message if you put charge and it go off after the battery hot fully drained....I gave it samsung service center on 13th june 13 after the lockdown still they are working on it first week they said they are awaiting patches from Samsung second week they said mother board has to be changed and this week i dont know what they are going to say....I gave it for wife as a gift but she blames  that i haven't choosen a worthy one...I haven't used the mobile more than a month and it's surprise to hear a new mobile not even a Month old got mother board problem this shows the quality of the mobile...Most frustrating thing is none will your call they have land line and mobile number...If your fortunate they may answer you call after you continuously call them more than 50 times....If you want to put yourself in trouble by your hard earned money then you have to choose this mobile....\\n\", \"\\n  I recently purchased an M21 for my father and was more than happy with its overall performance, be it the camera, battery or software performance. Hence, decided to upgrade my mother's phone as well and Samsung M series being Proudly Made in India and a non Chinese but a Korean brand, ordered the M31 128GB.To my surprise, I was even more amazed when the phone arrived. Everything the M21 was best at, was carried over and the Camera performance was even more improved in every aspect.The sharpness, AF, colours, and also video performance was improved over M21 which itself is good.No wonder the phone is selling like hot cakes all over India. My only regret now is, I didnt knew the M31s was launching. Else I would have waited for the M31s which going by the reviews, is a monster in Camera segment.Anyway, since my moms and dads phones have been set and purchased already, I think I need a phone upgrade for myself and it sure will be a Samsung. Probably the upcoming A71S 5G or an A51s 5G since i have read up about the about to be released Samsung phones.\\n\", \"\\n  I bought this mobile in last Friday , it is not working from 6th day. Unable to receive calls and if unexpectedly I received a call not getting sound and I can't here the opposite person voice or my voice to them. When I try to call someone automatically network is getting disconnected and it's reconnecting automatically in few minutes.I expect this might be software issue , I have gone through lot of reviews ,maximum number of people who buyed this mobile facing this issue.Unable to replace the mobile also as it is not showing any option to me. Plz no bay this mobile\\n\", \"\\n  Please don't buy this phone. It has major heating issues. It gets drastically heated while watching videos, while taking photos, during calls and also while charging. 6000mah battery is just for name sake. It works for 1 to 1.25 days without heavy usage. Full charging takes upto 3hrs.

Very inconvenient to use.... I regret buying this phone! So expensive... N yet below average performance.... I have to always hold the phone close to my mouth so that other person can hear well....

This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. I'm writing after a few days of usage and Again I re-order from this same model same colour and same configuration. price range very attractive and all requirement full fill. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide-angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. I may not require to carry my DSLR everywhere.Delivery was fast, packing was good,I share my experience with my friend they also buy this same product and also happy.Good:- Wi-Fi Calling Facility is to good.- The display is excellent with Blue light filter.- The performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery (More than 1.5 Days running with Internet)- 512 GB Memory card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Fast charging and 15W charger top with the phone.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is goodBuild Quality:This phone is fully made of plastic but the build quality is good.

One UI 2.0 based on Android 10 out of the box5. Dolby Atmos SupportCons:1. Exynos 9611 is fair enough to handle the daily work but it's a little old processor, it would be better if it would come with any of the latest ones.2. Fingerprint sensor is adequately fast but it's a capacitive and back mounted. It would be better if it would have in display one.3. The phone has a massive 6000 mAh battery and it supports fast charging only upto 15 watt. It would be better if would support 25 watt because it takes quite a time to charge the battery fully.N.B. I am not a gamer. I haven't done any gaming. You will need to go to YouTube for gaming reviews.\\n\", '\\n  No quality in camera functions, battery is like normal phones only No change in it. Fingerprints accessible is not quick, phone is getting heat while in communication or using product. While using applications phone is getting hanged.\\n', '\\n  I ordered this phone first time it came with a number of issues like overheating and damaged product. Second time when they replaced they again gave me a phone with poor battery performance which does not even lasts upto 12hrs.With similar usuage with other persons known to us it is lasting upto 24 hrs plus. We have deliberated checked this issue. Overall a unsatisfactory experience.\\n', '\\n  1. Basic features is missing put in this phone like app lock etc.2. 64MP Camera quality is not up to the mark, it looks like an ordinary camera.3.  Phone is little bit slow.4.  Feels heavy in hand.5.  Took so long for charging.\\n', '\\n  Phones battery life is good but it gets heated for example when you are on call for a long time for while booking cabs when location is on it takes a lot of battery No pop up notifications in WhatsApp phone needs work in accessibility I am a low vision person the phones keyboard gets too much expanded when using zoom gesture making it impossible to type I have to reboot the whole phone to get the keyboard to its normal size . Select to speak options hangs frequently and the phone becomes unaccessible.after my purchase there was a software update due to which my screen gets zoom automatically creating problem while using which is very irritating face recognition is not that good phone takes two and a half hour to charge completely.Camera is really nice beautiful pictures come out.\\n', '\\n  Missing app lock and secure folder, I hope software update will fix it in future.Headphone is missing 😩.Downloaded s secure from galaxy store for App lock.Removed unnecessary preloaded apps.Add restrictions for background data if you want to save data and battery.Great Camera tested in all moods(check in pictures).Night mood is superb.Anyone posting bad reviews about camera is personal intentions.Freefire or pubg consums 6% battery per hour. But remember it depends on your network speed.Fast charging is working perfectly,Still moving my apps from old galaxy J7 Pro, I will update my review after 1 month.Nice phone.\\n', '\\n  Very bad phone, not worth it. Even Amazon refused to to do the replacement. Feeling cheated by amazon. Next time no purchase any expensive item from Amazon.\\n', \"\\n  Don't buy. Not worth 15k. Worst camera. Phone is getting warm for normal usage(not even playing games). You cannot return this after buying. Amazon will tell stories instead of refunding.Amazon technician is not visiting on time and it's very frustrating after paying 15 k for this nonsense piece. Farid amazon.\\n\", \"\\n  Updates after couple of weeks of usage!!‐----‐--‐---------‐-----Stay away from this! Biometrics is a joke! Never ever again will choose a Samsung product for mobile!Updates after couple of days usage...1. Battery power seems to be good!2. Fast charging is a let down!3. Finger print sensor doesn't work most of the times and required constant cleaning!! I would rather use face lock!!4. Memory (6GB) is not performing well. Recommend to go for 8GB.=====================================With lot of excitement, i bought this phone and to my disappointment it is an utter flop! Phone heated up like anything which i was setting it up and I could immediately feel that the phone had problems. May be for 16K this is what you get?? But might disappointed as I have used other low cost phones and have never faced such problems. Now, I thought Samsung as a brand was good, but I realized that it is not about the brand name always. Stay away from this model,5 star for shipping and delivery. However the product is a let down!!!\\n\", \"\\n  I purchased Samsung NEW on the very day of its launch. Got delivery next day. Actually it arrived before estimated time.This I have been using the phone for about one week now. It's a fantastic phone.1. Design, slimness, weight is very impressive.2. Display sAMOLED is simply superb. Color production stunning.3. I have purchased M30s also a few months ago. M31's display is even better than M30s.4. Battery lasts for about 2 days on usual use time. I have Samsung On Max also. Which I have to charge twice a day. But NEW easily runs for 2 days.5. Camera is also very good, both rear and front. I have taken some night photos without using flash. They, beautifully captured the subjects with clear details. Front camera is equally good.6. It's lighter than M30s (which is also having 6000mah battery).7. Phone doesn't get heated up much even on continuous use.8. One good feature Samsung has added is caller identity. It detects spams automatically. No need to install Truecaller.9. It also has QR Code scanner. This is very helpful.Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price range. I am fully satisfied having purchased this phone10. Night mode photos are stunning. The first photo given above is of Hyderabad nightline, taken from my balcony.11. Next two photos are of clouds taken from an Indigo flight.12. Next snap is of cardamom flowers in my garden.13. The last one is pav baked by me at home. Snap taken with Food Mode. I found in food mode pictures coming alive.I especially impressed with night mode and food .Ode photos. They are si.ply superb.\\n\", '\\n  Not worth it when you compare it with Xiaomi phonesIssues--Heavier than MI phones--Screenshot is not by scrolling  3 fingers as in MI phones. You need to press power button and volume button simultaneously--screen mirroring is very poor does not works-- Camera is also poor than MI phones-- while opening web link gives only one option to open using Samsung Browser.-- many other usability issues.--overall you will feel going back to MI due to issues in usability\\n', \"\\n  Thanks a lot Amazon for this superb phone. After using the phone for one week I am writing down the reviews. Please go through the same it will help you.1:- Superb super amoled display you cannot get in this range. 5 stars2:-Battery - No words for battery simply awesome 5 stars3:- Camera :-If you have used oppo,vivo or realme then you will not like the camera quality of phone.But if you are using it for the first time then you will like. But camera quality can be better as per this price segment.If you are camera lover then you can go for other phones.Macro camera is worst.4 stars4:-Performance :- Not upto the mark. Sometimes there is a lag. 3.5 stars5:- Games :- If you are game lover then do go for this. 3 stars6:- Storage :- Go with 128 GB storage option don't go for 64 GB 4 starsSo now it's your choice which option you want to go.The charger cable which is received is of low quality and it's very loose. The packing of the phone was not that much good. Not expected from samsung.

Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.● JBL  - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.Connector is bent, but not in perfect \"L\" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect \"L\" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●COMFORT :------------● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●LOUDNESS :-------------CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.●●  WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :---------------------------------------------I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :----------------------------------● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :PNOTE: boAt & JBL both\\'s mics works with android and iOS perfectly.●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●CUSTOMER CARE :--------------------● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn\\'t got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●CONNECTIVITY :------------------All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.VERDICT :----------I don\\'t think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.Hope this review helps you make sound decision.\\n', '\\n  I had purchased these boat headphones on may 2017. Suddenly it has stopped working after just 4 months. It has a warrenty of 1 year. I want this product to be replaced as soon as possible. I need headphones badly. Such a bad experience with amazon as i have not done any major shopping yet on amazon. Just want this product to be replaced man.\\n', '\\n  I bought this earphone by friend suggest. I am using this earphone and have not faced any problems yet. Mostly I used headphone during traveling for listening music and watching videos. After two months of usage this headphone, I am giving review.• I got the product well packed by Amazon.• I ordered Neon Lime Color and It’s a decent color.• In packed box  got 3 pairs extra earbuds with different sizes.• Sounds are amazing. Sounds are high with Extra Bass  but we can adjust. Sounds are much clear than others earphones I have ever used. No noises during calling.• Length of the headphone is 1.2 meters. That is perfect for everyone.• Wires are sturdy and strong.• Jacks are metal and strong.VerdictGuys go for it. Value for money. Its reasonable price.\\n', '\\n  Its been 3 months since i purchased this product, headphones were good at the beginning, i used the product very rarely and now when i plug it in my ears no audio plays on right and audio decreases and increases in left then I got a new one replaced as soon I posted complaint to official mail ID. The new one works perfectly well would like to thank boat for their Customer Sevice.\\n', '\\n  Sound is good , these earphone are good except one thing: the earphones are really very heavy and you cannot put it into your ears as it will fall down. That is the main reason that I have to return this product.Not only me, I have seen my colleagues having the same issues so I would recommend not to buy thisOtherwise sound quality and bass is very good.\\n', \"\\n  I'm writing review after one year, i had sennheiser cx 180 and i bought this coz it had  mic. i wil not compare this bad boat earphone as  right side  of earphone stopped working within 6 months. I sent to service center and replaced it. even that stopped working within 3 months.  sennheiser cx 180 and it worked for almost 3yrs years without any issues. now i have MI earphone with mic and it's working fine.\\n\", '\\n  One of the worst ever used headphone in my life time.Main drawback of this earphone is its weight. Due to metal body it weighs more which cause it to fall from ear very often.Also it is not at all comfortable with any of the ear buds they have given with box.Over all experience is very bad from one month. I prefer not to go for this product unless you want to try something worst.I want to give 0 stars for this product.\\n', \"\\n  The product is just perfect for the price range! I have used sony and jbl before, but they lack some or the other features like sound quality,noise cancellation and even the built quality. But this one just ticks all the boxes. You can go for it if you are looking for a earphones under 1k.Pros:Better Sound quality than it's competitorsBuilt quality is great (metal finish)Better Noise cancellation than it's rivalsBass is just awesome (I'm a fan of it)Better pricing of all.Cons:Nothing as of now\\n\", \"\\n  Starting from pricing according to product quality product is excellent in this price point cost is too affordable and according to the cost they are delivering much better.Quality of material can much better on this little bit more effort required from brand end.Performance is overall good if you like boomy sound, for bass lover this is the perfect product at this price point.But if you audiophile than this is not product for you. Lacking in sound vocals and mid level it is not perfect, but yes you cannot expect that audiophile sound from this price point.I am testing this after lot of recommendations yes some extent it is perfect but not up to the mark.Anyway I am very found of music is like addiction for me.Whenever I listen to the music it will take into the flashback in some time it gives me anergy and motivate me.But yes most of the time whenever I listen music the frames of the girl I liked the most take me with her assumptions.I liked her like anything, but thing is that whenever I like someone beyond the expectation always ditch me.In short I am the king of bad luck in this.Starting I don't like her she is not that attractive in ist impressions. But yes when I know her completely she is the most beautiful girl in this earth I ever found of my life.Very frankly guys lot of girls will be in my life, but yes it is all time pass I never be serious the way I with her.I am still confused BTW love luster and affcatuion, may be it temporary feelings or my serious love or lust I am still confused.But yes I like her like anything I want her be in my life.Considering my situation it won't be possible as I am already a settled manBut still I was hopeful. All the time I was thinking about her.And Frame in mind that she also like me may be she is or she was not.But I am still confident that she liked me but may be expressing my feelings with her the way proposed her totally wrong.Ahh the moment let me share with you guys  she was with me and hole day I spend with her that was my sweetest memories in my life and the finally come up with the big moments.We were about to go to bed let me clear we both are going to sleep separately yes the moment I offered her to keep water with her and it's time say good night guys.But the moment I told he that I want a kiss ahhh she nervous like anything and I am also guys belive me the feeling is like that I am offering or proposing some to for kiss some ist time. She is not even the position of saying something she told me what and I told her sorry I left her and came into my room.. I am nervous about her reaction and confess her sorry no of time on WhatsApp but she didn't even reply.Whole night I will awake and very stressed.Morning she came my room with the cup of tea no conversation BTW us.She was angry on me finally I told her sorry face to face.She started scoaltin me like anything this is ist ever worst experience in my life.But yes I am very egoistic guy everyone told me but I never even mind her anything she told me don't take any stressed go and back to you work.She told me that she made a lot mistake in her life.I know her past she was love in some man.Who is more than  double age of her yes she liked him like anything considered all the things I still want her to be in my life.Her behavior totally changed as earlier I know her, she behaved me I feel some time enforier, but anyway I am still in love with her.Lastely she told me that she never liked me that I don't believe may be this is my wrong assumption but yes it never me in my life  I am very good predictor.May she was fed up with previous things or she want to settle in her life.My best wishes with always her I want that she will be the happiest person in her life.I am little with jealous with that luck man who is supposed be coming in her life but yes lot of regards of her is on me.Beyond the expectation I am hoping her best future and she will be very good wife lovers caring.I like her nature like anything may this was the reason I love her oh still I love her.Knowing unknowingly I heart two three times, please accept my deepest apologies.And surely will be together in this like of May be in next life.\\n\", \"\\n  In short: It's awesome don't think twice before buying it.In long:Quality- 10/10. Very high quality materials are used in it. Headphone jack is gold plated and the connector is very sturdy. Plastic quality is also great. Sound chamber is made out of metal. Wires don't get tangled, unlike some of it's competitors it also uses flat cables but unlike them it doesn't get tangled at all.Durability-10/10. After using it 6 months continuously and meticulously, all I can see they're like tanks and are very sturdy in nature. Even after having few accidents with them they're more or less in pristine condition.Audio- In this category it'll score out of the boundary six. Noise cancelling and audio output of the headphones are boon for every audiophile.Comparison- Between it and a Xiaomi Headphone, the difference is night and day. It's hands-down a miles ahead of the Xiaomi.\\n\", \"\\n  Better than expected! Great Indian product, very clear and  bass is super. Due to high bass, peak volume makes more sound which can't be avoided in this type of earphones. Long quality cables. It's slipping from ear as it has more weight in outside, it's required for high bass earphones. That's the reason, ear hook is given along. Buttons and mic is good.\\n\", \"\\n  I won't suggest you, if you will buy this then you will be stuck and Amazon won't allow to return your poor machine.I don't like this. The wire is heavy and feels like a cable . Also it's very heavy so doesn't fit in my ears.it come out and hurting my ears. The very sad part is, I'm trying to return it but amazon is not having return options only they can replace it where they are not understood customer prospects that of it doesn't fit to my requirements Nd not comfortable then what will I do with replacement. Very disappointed\\n\", \"\\n  Pros:-1_ Sound quality is decent, bass is upto the mark.2_ Wire material is sturdy and strong.3_ Non tangling earphone.4_ You get extra earbuds(3 pairs).5_ Earphone with microphone, has button for track change and pause/play.Cons:-1_ Overall the Earphone is a bit heavy.2_ The wire seems to be longer than an Earphone should have. It sometimes gets stuck. I am a fairly tall guy and still I find it long.3_ Not the most comfortable earphones. Earbuds don't properly adjust in ears, and the rubber hook(or whatever it is called) leads to ear pain.Edit:-So due to the length of the wire, one day my earphone's wire did get stuck at a table corner and broke. The wire got detached from the microphone. Although I registered a complaint, and they picked up my product to get it repaired, and later called me to say that they don't repair it. They will just replace it if warranty conditions are fulfilled. So a 600 ₹ practically flushed down the toilet.\\n\", '\\n  This earphone is not even worth Rs.99/-. I cannot believe all the rave reviews this product got !!It has sub-standard sound, no sound stage to speak of, a tinny muddied sound and bass is just an echo. All the frequencies are bunched up together. If Amazon would allow me to return it, I would have done it in a heart beat. Buy a Sennheiser of an MI Earphone.\\n', \"\\n  BUT #1Been using these since 2017 but they had earlier died within 5 months of use. Lucky the one year warranty helped me get them fixed. The company actually gave me a replacement as the left ear piece just wouldn't work.BUT #2The earphones are HEAVY..! This is because of the metallic body and the weight of the drivers of the earphones. So forget about wearing these in the gym or while running. They fall ALOT during vigorous activities.Now let's get to the good part..The BASS.. Omg is simply.. Love! I couldn't believe the level of low end for the price and size of these earphone. The mids are good but the highs lack definition, which is alway the case with cheaper bass heavy earphones. However I purchased these with a purpose to watch movies & enjoy my bass heavy music. These were not bought to enjoy every track in high quality. When I am on the move I need heavy bass, loud volume, a quality microphone and reasonably decent audio clarity at an adorable price which this product delivers spoton. The cable is tangle free which is very handy.For whenever I wish to evolve myself in high quality music, I plug in my Bose to enjoy the audiophile experience but the price points are very different to compare.Conclusions - If you're some who watches alot of movies on the go, listen to the new trending music which is especially bass heavy and need a decent microphone for your phone call.. Buy this with confidence!If you found this review useful kindly hit the HELPFUL button below.\\n\", \"\\n  Considering the price the Bass is actually quite good.Talking about treble its above average you won't need to worry if you are a bass lover! Mic is Good Enough . Build quality is just awesome as its having metal Casing and a durable enough flat cable (if cared properly).Comfortenes is where i feel it can be improved as its slips out sometimes because of its weighty body but it can be fixed using wings.My email- ani05official@gmail.com\\n\", '\\n  this is not a worth product to try even due to following reasons :1.  it is very bulky in nature for a ear in phone2. the ear piece is not comfortable for a normal size ear , so feels very uncomfortable on the ear.3. the sound quality is just ok, and the other person may not hear you properly.4. there is no option to pick the call from the earphone, as no button is available on the earphonethere is one positive aspect also with these earphone that they are really rigid , so probably lasts long as compared to normal fragile ones.\\n', \"\\n  I have heard a lot about BoAt earphones and it sounds great..just like it's name. I was eagerly waiting for this  to experience how it's functionality actually will be. I got the  exact (neon lime)colour earphone that I was expecting. Delivery was on time.The packaging inside comprises of-  6 neon lime colour and 4 black colour  earbuds of different sizes.- one wing tip and a clipperAlong with that a 1 year warranty card.The best thing about this product is the earphone Jack and a flat wire which in turn results in less occurrence of tangle.About it's performance, it delivers a super bass quality sound. It fits properly on ears, so no complains till now. It feels awesome to listen as the quality of material along with the clarity in sound makes it different from other earphones. Hope it will last till long.\\n\", \"\\n  This is my second earphone my first one was same of the same color. I just pulled the wired of the first one it lasted for 2 year. BOAT products are too much durable and I just love their bass and under 799 this is the great product and this product is better than jbl C100SI one. The sound are crisp and bass is boosted.pros_-More bassGold plated jackmicrophone has a good range of capturing audioMicrophone just cancel the outdoor noise in most cases.Vocal are goodTangle free cableAnd most ImportantPubg sounds are very clear you can play PUBG monile with this headphonesCons-Driver unit is a little bit heavy But for me it doesn't create a problem because i have used this product for 2 year.Vocal could be more clear.My overall opinion-As i have used this product for 2 year  My opinion will matter,This product is durable and 200% worth the moneyI recommend this product to everyone...............specially PUBG lovers :}\\n\", \"\\n  I'm really impressed with these earphones. These are one of the few ones that have lasted for such a long time, close to a year, that too with rather loose maintenance care.But what I am most impressed with is the customer service.  The earphones did develop an issue with the mic volume being rather low. I wasn't actually sure if I should go for the warranty or just get a new one since it was so close to the warranty expiry. But I took a leap and contacted customer care regarding the issue and they promptly arranged the replacement at no cost to me. I am seriously impressed with this. It's the first time I'm seeing this in India.So kudos to BoAt!!! I'm definitely looking you up the next time I need audio stuff.PS - and with the price I'm even more stunned! Can't go wrong with these!\\n\", '\\n  Good build quality, best sound quality, high durability and worthy for every penny.\\n', \"\\n  I am reviewing it after 8 months usage.Durability:-  First one stopped working so I contacted to manufacturer and they replaced it . They took more than 10 days to replace it which was pathetic because I had to buy a new earphone for the meantime.  In the meantime I purchased Mi earphone at rs.399 only which is cheaper than this earhpone and quality is better than this.Sound Qaulity :- After 15-30 minutes regular usage you will feel uncomfortable because it starts paining due to it's design.Material Quality:- Material is good but it doesn't matter until you get great experience with sound quality.Overall I am not happy with the quality. It's better to go with other earphones in the range of Rs.350-Rs.400.\\n\", '\\n  Normally one earpiece of my ear phones goes bad in 3-4 months , Even the expensive one from big brand who claim to be \" the first company of sound engineers \" did not last for more than 6 months, But this has been working absolutely fine for me and there is also no degradation in sound quality and clarity ... ::RECOMMENDED::\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality is good at this price point but it's not the best.Bass is killer but highs & lows are little bit fussy.The earphones are made of metal so it's a bit heavy.According to the durability it has a L shaped 3.5mm jack gold plated so it's gonna last long if someone is a heavy user or roughly use the earphones.All over good earphone to buy & worth to buy.You're not gonna regret after buying this earphone 😁👍\\n\", \"\\n  I am a music lover and most of the day I listens up the music and that too 3 hours approximatelyPros :1} Quality of material is really amazing and high premium quality wire has been used by manufacturers2} Extra ears buds in various sizes as an extra accessories feels really soft to ears which is good for long hours usage without any irritation, feels very fit and comfortable3} Amazing base and bits, clear vocals, beats, great and powerful output sound quality4} Tangle free wire in flat shaped that's another great feature5} head set cups made of metals for amazing performance and longer durabilityCons:1} that head set cups is little bit heavier but believe me after few days of usage doesn't even feel once you use to itOverall all its an great experience and thanks for boat for such amazing product\\n\", \"\\n  I simply love this product. Its more than a product; a philosophy.It's made with tons of love.Everyone could make better headphones, but they don't. As if they want people to keep buying new ones.This one is so so durable- the jack angle and material where it becomes a wire, is so optimised that it doesn't break.- the packing was so wonderful, and the card inside it, talked about the headphone, and one could tell that they made it with a lot of love.- the best part is the flat wires, and they have never entagled for me or my friends, ever, in months.- the sound is very good, in this cost range, exceeds expectation- the plugs are metal, and that's so cool- they gave us so many earbuds, as if they really don't want us to throw it away just because we lost the budsThey are a young company, maybe, and it seems as if they are giving a tight slap into the face of the other headphone companies.I simply love the product.\\n\", \"\\n  Not a good purchase. Made mistake. Purchased 5months back . Bow are my top 2 reasons1. Doesn't fit I to the ears properly, falls off quite often from either of the years.2. Absloutely no noise cancellation . Have been trying to use it on laptop to attend calls but found it a pain to do so\\n\", '\\n  Sound Quality is below average. In-Ear is only in the name. Does not sit comfortably, ideally in the ear. Very uncomfortable listening to music for long hours.Previous purchases with better quality are listed as below (In order of preferences) 1. Sony MDR-EX150AP In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black) 2. JBL T110 In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black) 3. Sennheiser CX 180 Street II In-Ear Headphone (Black), without Mic\\n', \"\\n  A very durable metal bass heads head phones with mic. Good quality distortion/noise free sound and tested at high volumes.This who complained about not fitting to ear canal, need to change the provided earbuds  with the smaller size. Even I faced similar issue and changed to the smaller earbuds which gives a perfect fitting and doesn't drop off while walking or jogging.\\n\", '\\n  I have always used the original headphones that sony provided with their walkman series phones before android came. In case of issues, i havr always bought original headsets from sony centers brcause of their product and sound quality. This was the first time i invested in a headset from someone other than sony and i must say - these headsets are  very nice. They sound very good. They have buds so they block outside noice and u get to experience pure sound. The wires are also quite good in quality and are less like to get tangled. Good bang for yhe bucks.\\n', \"\\n  I have to say I am really annoyed with the purchase..the fit is very uncomfortable..I tried all the six pai uprs of ear buds.. nothing worked for me..if you even move a bit the ear plugs falls off.. so please try any other brand..Edit:- after a month I still couldn't find a way to make it work..it keeps falling down.. please avoid this piece..I tried 1more piston it was slightly expensive than this but really awesome to listen and very comfortable.. going to get one soon.\\n\", \"\\n  First when i bought this i was thinking how it will be but It has the bestest sound quality in under 2000 earphones, it is better than sony earphones.Other companies don't have the wire quality like this earphone.It has a great surround sound quality.I tried more than 3 months and its giving meSame performance as it is new.It has balanced sound,  and noice-cancelingFeature is good.While calling microphone works well and quality is good.I must tell you that if your budget is upto 2000 rupees than it is best for you.\\n\", \"\\n  Worst product I  have ever bought. Sound quality is very poor. Bass is of no use. It's very heavy due to that metal bud keeps falling off often and often. Extra buds are of no use it doesn't adjust to my ears. Can't use for more than 5min I started getting headache. Continues use of it may lead to serious health issues. Regretting for wasting ₹599/- for such a worst product. I don't know how people gave 5 stars. By reading the reviews I bought it and now threw it in the dustbin. For music lovers it's a big NO.. Highly recommended not to buy. I give 0 star.\\n\", '\\n  A very good product for Rs.500/-. I\\'m not an audiophile, but compared to other cheap earphones, this one is far superior in both physical and audible quality. The wire shows no signs of stress or strain even after 6 months of use. The audio also sounds (and feels) very good, as does the bass. Also has a mic and a button, which most earphones don\\'t seem to have these days. Comes with extra earbuds, a clip, and earhooks. The wires are flat, which means very low chances of them entangling.Worse part is that due to the quality, it is quite heavy, making it fall out of your ears. Thankfully, you can adjust the earbuds and make use of provided clip and hooks, but being light would\\'ve been better. Couple of months after purchase the volume dropped badly due to some internal problem, but it (almost) fixed itself a week later. I still hear some static on high bass, though, which is a shame for a \"BassHead\".All in all, it worked better than any other earphone I\\'ve bought so far, and seems like it will for a lot more time.(I see the rate has increased now. I bought this specifically because it was cheaper than others, had a mic, and looked to be of good quality. If this is still the cheaper option out there, then I can assure you you\\'ll get the best bang for your buck.)\\n', '\\n  If you are a jogging & gymming person and want to pump yourself up with some good music then this is definitely a cool choice. But hey, you need to be little careful with purchasing decisions as mic might be problematic.Mic of my boat headphones went off in 5th month after purchase. Yes, it can be replaced as it has a year warranty but I just want this problem to never arise on the very first note.\\n', \"\\n  Painful for ears, can't keep it for long duration. Also, it keeps on falling from ears on every shift/action you do. When others call, either they get irritated or I get irritated as the mic is useless and you need to continuously keep it in front of your mouth. I've seen other people talking on other earplugs easily talking without holding it continously. One ear plug stopped working even within guarantee period.\\n\", \"\\n  Mids and Vocals are bad.If you adjust equalizer or not by default it has huge bass. And huge bass will irritates you while listening, product quality is poor and ear buds and speaker hook will make noise every time while you inserting into your ears. Overall, am not suggesting to buy anyone. If you are really a music lover, pay 200 or 300 more and go for high and standard one.It has only 'play', 'pause' and 'next' functions.  It doesn't have Volume controller which is disaster, every time if you want to increase or decrease  volume, you have to take your phone and control it; it is giving you pain.Not worth for the money.\\n\", \"\\n  Good: the mic. I tried boAt's cheaper earphones and mic on this is definitely superior.Bad : Bass. I was super excite after reading the reviews but I heard no bass at all. cheaper version had much better bass.Ugly: design. these earbuds keep falling if you do any thing other than sitting idle. I tried all sizes of ear tips that were given but no luck. when I complained this to family, my cousin said that she also had problem with one of these and she switched to boAt bluetooth headphones.This is after 3 to 4 days of usage. I'll update after a month if my experience changes.\\n\", '\\n  No complaints, not looking for a super high quality listening so I find this best one out there for low budget yet good quality listening.Best feature: flat wire and angled jack, these two feature makes it more lasting and moreover you get bunch of earbuds.Side note: remember to hang the wire around your neck as you put on your earphones because it is little heavy and tends to slip off every now and then.\\n', '\\n  Listen , all the zist and proper points. I am reviewing it after 1year over.and still working good.1. The packaging quality is superb.2. Low budget nice headphone.3. Headphone material is also good.4. Though it has tangible wires, but i get many times gets messy.5. The sound quality is awesome. It has good bass, good treble. Deep and punchier coz its freq.response is tood good comore to other brands. But you might found the clarity is bit less as compare to JBL, SEINHEISSER, SONY. There is noise little bit.6. The mic was preety decent before but now it works bt still other person over the phone gets very disturbed coz it creates lots of noise., dnt know why.7. Last, I will say.. U can go for it without hesitation, if ur range is within 500 to 600.\\n', \"\\n  I loved this earphone and very satisfied with its performance but their is one con that it comes out of the ear beacuse of its metal body so if you are ok with it then buy without thinking otherwise ant audio is best but u can't get the customer care experience of boat from ant.\\n\", '\\n  This headphone was amazing... I love this  headphone.. Sound quality was good.Bass quality mindblowing ..quality was very good .. best headphone under this price\\n', '\\n  Not happy with the sound qualityI am using it from 2 weeksBass is okDelivery was fine\\n', \"\\n  The Headphone stopped working after 12 days of purchase. I tried reaching the customer service via call for 2-3 days continuously but always busy tone comes. Pathetic customer service. Product too not that good. I won't recommend buying the headphone.\\n\", \"\\n  I have used boat products previously and suddenly all my friends have started recommending me Boat’s products. I work in the Film industry where the sound is one of the most essential elements and no matter whether you have or have not, a good earphone is a must.Apple gives good earphones but they break after a while but the sound quality they provide is excellent. The problem is that first, they are super expensive and second, they don't last long.Most other earphones in the same range will give far inferior product and their sound quality is so bad that it will only damage your eardrums and give your headaches. Here is a detailed view of why I find the Boat earphones to be one ofthe best that there is –------Pros\\uf0a7 If you are ordering from Amazon, then you have a well packed good product in your hands. I have also found that I am unable to find the Boat products easily in the general market.\\uf0a7 Wires are like strap, flat and very strong. Unlike earphones which gives you a rubbery feeling, these earphones will give you more of a plastic feeling.\\uf0a7 The wire does not coil itself and if it does, it is easy to open it because of the of the smooth strapped flat shape of wires.\\uf0a7 The sound is amazing. It does not break even when I took the volume a little higher.\\uf0a7 They are easily stuck on ears and does not fall off.\\uf0a7 The wire is long enough for you to put laptop one side and watch movies from a distance.\\uf0a7 The microphone is also awesome as I sang songs and made voice notes, for which it was clear and precise. Sometimes more than required. It even captured my breathing sound from a distance.\\uf0a7 The earbuds have a metallic look and are strong. There is no question you have to buy another earphone for an entire year.\\uf0a7 It comes with an entire set of different custom earbud covers. It helps because different people have different ear sizes and according to them they can use it for their ears. It also comes with cervical ear support which helps in putting an earbud to connect more impactfully to your ear without giving you pain. It helps if you don’t want earbuds to fall in case of strong movements.\\uf0a7 Most important, though the price is less, the boat products do not look very cheap and boasts of a good brand name.------Cons\\uf0a7 Are you kidding me? Till now there are no cons for me. With the price tag attached to it, it is literally the best bargain you can get on an earphone. My brother has two of them in different colours and loves them.------Final OpinionDon’t think twice before ordering it. There are tremendously good reviews all over for Boat products and lately, I have seen more and more people leaning towards this product. I cannot tell you how many people have recommended me this earphone and those friends of mine have never faced any problem of any kind.Without a doubt, the best company that there is today on Amazon. If you are planning to buy it, do it. You won't regret it.------\\n\", \"\\n  The earphones are pretty good. It gives a decent sound output with quite a good amount of bass. People saying the bass isn't good have definately damaged their eardrums already so don't fall for their words.The discomforts I felt was as the earphones are little heavy so I have to use hooks so that they don't fell out from my ear but plonged use of the earphones (little over one hour) make me uncomfortable. Secondly the jack is 90 degrees bent so if the phone is my pocket while I am riding my bike, a little twist in the jack causes it to disconnect from phone.\\n\", '\\n  Excellent build quality and tangle free cable  sound quality:  is good coming base qaulity is excellent and volcals are clear ....  Quality: IS good and tangle free cable.  And build quality is alluminium and Excellent build qualityNoise cancellation: is good noise cancel but sometimesPrice : IAM buy this product lightening deals 499 price may vary to day to day.Pros : build quality , tangle free cable etcThis my review person to person may vary to\\n', \"\\n  The sound is fuller than most products in this range, the volume is intense and can never push it to full because it gets too loud. You can wear them on a bike with helmet on and in a gym environment where loud music is already playing in the background as this drown out everything. They're not sweatproof or water resistant so be careful. Any sweat will disrupt the earphone and might render the mic useless. The earphones are extremely comfy, the extra ear tips are in various sizes therefore can fit almost all ears. I replaced the stock with the smaller ones for a snug and comfy fit that doesn't pain after prolonged use. The wire is actually tangle free and the build quality is overall satisfactory even sturdy. The downside and the reason why I'm not giving it 4 stars is that the mic stopped working 1 day after my return to amazon date expired. So within a week the mic went kaput. Just won't work.\\n\", \"\\n  For someone who wouldn't bother even visiting the product listing again, I am forced to write this review.Let me put the record straight, this has to be one of THE BEST headphones in its category for sure! I've never used a Sony, JBL or Sennheiser before, but I could confidently bet my money on boAT for sure.To begin with, the BASS! It not only vibrates the innermost part of your ears but can potentially blow your skull away.....literally!I had purchased the Motorola Pulse Escape (Bluetooth) headphones for around Rs 3000/- and could not have been happier to have exchanged them for this pair.For under Rs 500/- this is an absolute steal! Go for it without a second thought!Good job boAT team!!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\\n\", '\\n  CONS: The sound is horrible, it does not capture the most basic frequency range properly. If you are into guitar based music like Rock and Metal, then this is going to disappoint you. The bass is middy and does not cover the low end properly, the mids sound scooped, the treble falls short of its full range. It also has a very phony surround sound which makes it harder to hear what is really playing. The earphones fail to do what they are intended for.PROS: The material and the overall quality is nice, the earphones are sturdy. The packet also comes with superfluous accessories, so no issue there.\\n', \"\\n  I don't know why people gave nice ratings for this product. I received product today, when I start listen the music comes like local earphones. Full sound without clarity. I'm not able to listen seriously. I requested for replacement now. I have only one option now. There is no refund. Now I came to know if we invest much money only we get good music. Previously I had Sony earphone which is worth of RS.1200/-. Compared to that it's totally waste. Better Samsung earphone with earbuds are best than this. Samsung earphones are 350/- only. I brought this for 599/-. Please don't buy. Full volume but no clarity.\\n\", \"\\n  **** DO NOT BUY THIS **** WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT THOUGHT THEY CLAIM WARRANTY ***Left side ear phone stopped working within 5 months of purchase. very poor. Their Customer care and warranty claim mechanism is very bad that I have sent my head phone back to them but don't where it is and it's been more than weeks and no response from their side. 24/7 nobody picks call from the support side of Boat.The ear bud is not intact. Keeps falling out every now and then.Later got a replacement for the complaint i filed and again I got a defective product and different color(I was fine with that).When connected to mobile , songs gets automatically paused and played continuously and never lets you to listen to songs at all.\\n\", '\\n  The bass is very good but after using two months this earphone has started showing sound problems. It automatically increases and decreases phone or laptop volume or will repeatedly turn on the google assistant. Initially i thought it might be a problem with my mobile but same problem when i tested this with other phone and laptop too. Very irritating while watching videos or listening to songs, almost damaged my eardrums as it suddenly raised the volume yo maximum multiple times. Have raised a complaint at their website. Lets hope they provide a replacement.\\n', '\\n  ◆◆◆Audio Quality◆◆◆The Audio quality of these headphone is really good compares to others in this price range. Boat promised what they say out of box ‘ Extraaaa Bass’, the Bass of these headphones are really high compared to others. An overall the sound output of this headphones are very high. During my test, I found these headphones have good audio quality compare to others at this price. If you like EDM and pop songs, then you love these Boat headphones. But I suggest reducing a volume of your phone while listening Sufi and romantic songs because by default these headphones have higher volume, so you didn’t feel clear audio. The once again Bass effect is really good with treble and vocal. You can easily distinguish between different instruments & sounds which are good for extra bass.◆◆◆Comfort◆◆◆When coming to comfort, first I am not very impressed with these headphones, but after a select right pair of ear tips, I feel better. If you use this boat headphones for a long time, then you feel a little bit awkward because of big capsule design. On the Noise Isolation, Boat BassHeads 225 are very good. Make sure that you have the right pair of ear tips on for better noise isolation & comfort. I use these headphone while bike driving and I weren’t able to hear outside noise, that’s really amazing. If you get popping issue which these earphones, then please use Ear Hooks provided with earphones.◆◆◆Final Words◆◆◆After comparison with other headphones, I say the Boat boAt BassHeads 225 is the best headphones around 500 Rs with a microphone. It has a solid build quality, good performance, low price, and more important extreme Bass. I highly recommend these headphones for Bass lovers & budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality & durable earphones at a reasonable price.** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know. Thank you so much 😊 **\\n', '\\n  I purchased this earphone seeing the discount thinking it would live upto the specifications but really it didn\\'t. Something which I liked is the build quality it\\'s just awesome but in case of audio output I had to go for an equaliser and still didn\\'t feel upto the mark. Clarity (7),  bass effect (6), treble (8) , mids(9), overall sound mix(8) are my observations. Guys don\\'t waste your money on this...... you can if you have extra Money to buy another one. Believe me senheiser cx 180 provided me \\'better in all aspects\\' sound. Never expect \"Super extra Bass\" or maybe my product is faulty..... check yours very carefully. I don\\'t know about other Boat products, higher models may be good\\n', '\\n  Excellent headphones..100% VFM headphones from Boat...Material quality: Very good quality headphones. Ear pieces are sturdy, rubbers are soft ,good quality wires,tangle free flat wires..Design: A personal variable..but i think it looks cool..but a little bit on the heavier side due to those metallic inserts on ear piece.Mic : Good quality mic, with in line controls. Provides a decent call clarity. Decent noise cancellation, though not the perfect.SOUND : Its really a great headphone for its price,especially when we consider the sound quality. I felt ,its too loud when compared to other good quality headphones. Trebles and mids are excellent. Bass is so good, but mind you dont conpare it with an xtrabass(sony). But for the price its giving excellent bass.Overall, except the loudness, its a superb buy at this price point...I would say, if u love bass n quality, in a below 600 rs range these are the best to go for.If u have little more budget,to get a balanced music, go for JBLc200si..If u want deep powerfull bass,quality n have a well stretched budget, go for Sony XB55 or Seinheiser cx275s\\n', '\\n  Pros:1. Durable2. Comes with a sports wear (so that the earplugs dont drop of when you exercise)3. Tangle-free cable4. Has 6 set of earpieces of different sizes. (two colours Grey and Black)5. Good Noise CancellationCons:1. Has more Bass2. Muffled Mids3. The frequency output is not really average but when tweaked can sound pretty good.Have been using it for two years, mostly while travelling in the city.Works just fine.\\n', \"\\n  Earphone ear piece is too big for ear opening and as a result it is almost impossible to comfortably ise them. They keep falling off of ears as they are unfit. Sound quality is fine but no point if can't be used due to such a big ear piece.\\n\", '\\n  First let me tell all here I am listening walkman since March 1986 ,i have listened  sony,aiwa  headphone for last 32 years and i must say this  headphone currently best,clear treble,Mega bass.I am really surprised by the sound quality of this product. I am not a boat fan but those who are giving neagative ,either they are anti bass fan or they have bad intention of maligning boat.and those who are in doubt my advise is to them go ahead and buy without hesitation.I would like to buy another one very soon.Thanks boat and amazon for faster delivery. bass 5 star,treble 5 star\\n', \"\\n  I am using this earphone and I found it very good. If soomeone is planning for this earphone then definitely go for it,you won't disappointed by it. Earlier I used skullcandy ( I also have skull candy headphone which is more better than earphone) and jbl earphone. This one is better than them.Everything is good and nice in this earphone. Even I find it better than any earphones I used before.Don't mind any negative reviews which is present here.Everything has some cons and pros but I am sure you will find its pros more than its cons.So don't bother by any negative review present here ,go for it if you are planning.Everything is perfect in this earphone whether it is sound balance, clarity, bass, quality, noise isolation all are perfect.\\n\", '\\n  Hey guys,My earphone busted in 2 months. Tried reaching Boats customer care, no one picks up the phone. Created a ticket and no response for the past 3 weeks. Do not buy their products if you are expecting warranty claims.This is my 3rd Boats headphone and my first time claiming warranty. Pathetic service. I feel bad for recommending this to my friends and colleagues. Gonna go back to JBL again.Update: after a month of following up on Boat Facebook support, they have replaced my earphone. There is no other way to reach the boat support team but just through FB only. Hope this helps.\\n', '\\n  The product is OK for 10 days and after face  the mic issues.Overall sounds are good.Built-in quality is good.Overall Headset quality is good.Thanks for the amazon guidelines for replacement.But I received the product with out extra accessories which was provided earlier, customer service needs to be improved.Even now after 3 months, it is not working....Very cheap quality products\\n', \"\\n  Very disappointed with customer service and the warranty conditions. I'd replaced the product within 1 year warranty & the replaced started malfunctioning within 3 months. BoAt's representative are saying that replacement of replaced product is against their policy, this emerges a doubt whether the replacement was original or refurbished.Regarding the product, the sound quality is amazing, the noise cancellation is good, a very bass for bass lovers but the piece is little heavy, so you might find it a little uncomfortable but so are the other earphones.I've recommended few of my friends for this product or other products from BoAt as I find it an amazing piece apart  from the customer service at this price.\\n\", \"\\n  Trendy color, metal casing, lengthy flat wire and good sound quality for the price. Product comes with 6 different sizes of ear plugs and a pair of ear hooks. Fixing the ear hooks was not very intuitive. Had to google to figure it out.  However the plugs and hooks don't fit well for me. Bit disappointment with the fitment and hence no 5 stars. BA should improve on this area. Wanted to return this item only for that reason. But there is no return option, only replacement is available.\\n\", \"\\n  The product does not do justice to the high ratings. It is not as good as others make it seem. I am an audiophile and I have used tens of headphones and earphones, and it is one of the worst I have used.Pros1. It is not expensive and hence most can afford it.2. It has really good bass, and hence if that's the only thing you need, go ahead.3. It is sturdy as the earpieces are made of metal. Falling on the ground doesn't harm it any way. Even sitting on it by mistake won't do any damage. Better than plastic earpieces in that regard.Cons1. The sound quality is horrible after you go above 50% volume. It sounds like those cheap speakers in marriage halls.2. The volume at full capacity is very very loud, loud enough to make one partially deaf.3. The worst of it all. It is very heavy and hence starts hurting the ears within a few minutes of usage.4. It has very poor noise cancellation unless you literally stuff it inside your ear canal which hurts even more.5. It is definitely not a product for lon term usage as you will always have pain in your ear canal and may also damage your eardrums if played at higher volumes.Verdict - Buy Sennheiser, Sony or Philips,.may last less but you will enjoy the experience.\\n\", '\\n  Dear Audiophiles,Let me start with saying you that if you are spotify/gaana/Wink users, please pay and upgrade your account. If you cant pay for these services, download songs to phone from other sites and listen in phone. Online basic account gives you pathetic music quality.Coming to the headset, most probably you guys are like me who dont know much about highs and lows, all we care is Clarity and Bass. In that context I must say this headset is pretty ok. There is too much hype for Bass of this headset but I found it below the bass of JBL. In this headset Above 70 percentage volume, bass dominantes vocals which in turn results in a situation where you cant catch the lyrics of song. But I think normally people plays songs at 70 percentage or less.Ok I know u guys are in a hurry, so let me put it in a nut shell as follows,Physical noise cancellation 9/10Sturdiness and Hardware Quality 9/10Comfort level 8/10Aesthetic 7/10 (Personally varies)Vocals 6/10 upto 70% volume. After that pathetic.Final Verdit: If you need 90% qualityBass+ 70 % good vocals go for JBL but its not Durable. Damages easily.( Around 600₹) If you need just 75% quality bass + 60% good vocals and good durability this boat headset is an option.If you need 65 % bass + 90% Good clarity vocals Durability +Comfortness + go for One More bullets headsets. (699₹)NB: I have with me these headsets models only. Thats why I posted a comparison realted to those. I am not an reviwer but an audiophile by heart.Like if you found useful.\\n', '\\n  My purpose of buying these headphones were mostly for meetings and calls as the maximum volume supported by my phone isn’t much. Here’s the review for my one month usage of these headphones (note that they are more based on the usage on call than listening to music)Pros:1. Tangle free flat wire with good wire length2. Buds completely insert in ear holes and provide ample noise cancellation3. Extra buds supplied with the pack4. Mic is almost in level to the mouth while speaking5. L shaped jack makes it easier for connecting to laptops or phones in pocketCons:1. Mic is not so sensitive, voice gets unclear if its idling at some distance from mouth. Have to be held close to mouth while talking2. Ear buds do not fit everyone’s ear and may keep on falling if your ear holes are smaller than average3. Buds fall off sometimes from its place, not firmly assembled4. Mic may get tangled to shirt collar while walking or sitting. Have to be properly adjusted.Even after these cons I will give it 5 rating as they are the best value for money wired earphones available in the market right now.\\n', \"\\n  Just received today not damaged everything working normally still not upto the mark. So I am writing cons first.Cons:1)Too much bass. Imagine watching a movie the music is louder than the voice. and the bass doesn't seem natural.Seems artificial. Not the best quality sound.2)If you want to try out the other silicon buds the provide. Good luck. It's  no less than a wrestling. You will feel like it will get damaged if you use that much force but you need to do it still if you want to use those buds otherwise use the ones that come by default.Pros:1) budget earbuds but as I mentioned bass is too much. So amazon basic is a better budget earbud. Even though Amazon basic looks and seems cheap the price is under cheap despite that it provides decent sound which is more than satisfactory.2)The wires are beautiful and tangle free.3)They provide a lot of spare buds(useless as I mentioned before) and clips and such.4)The L shaped jack really helps a lot.Overall: It's just an earphone with too much extra unnecessary bass.My Skullcandy smoking earbud mic stopped working so I ordered this one. but Skullcandy sound is far far better than this.\\n\", \"\\n  Update: i bought these headphones on 25th of march 2019 and i don't even remember when it stopped working, i think within 3-4 months...and it felt more heavy than earrings in my ears😡 finally i threw in the garbage and ordered jbl c200l something like that don't remember the name exactly, they had very bad wire quality, broke within two months and ₹100 more than older version jbl c100(decent/average sound quality, durable enough) which i used almost 2 years... finally i am using my more than 6 years old Sennheiser cx 180, just miss the mic but it has awesome sound quality,light weight, long hours usage without hurting my ears and durable wires.And it works surprisingly too good while playing pubg using in-built mic of mobile. No issues at all in any terms.Old review: They fall easily from my ears even after trying every earbud size. Rest are just fine. Built quality is good.\\n\", '\\n  Looking for earphones online ? This may be the best choice for you .if you are a stock android useR ,this earphone provides the best hearing experience.Some users reviewed that the sound get deteriorate above 60-70 % , but NO ..! the sound is still crispy and detailed even on 100% volume .The Black colour looks more classy then other colours ,it has a shiney pink tint on it which looks beautiful .if we talk about comfort.., do they well played here.,these are so comfortable .but we can purchase same audio quality earphone through the market , like ubon big daddy bass for less than 300 rs but the durability ,and comfort is not same as these earphones\\n', \"\\n  Been using these for more than six months. The sound quality is good but they're very poorly designed in terms of ergonomics. The earphones keep falling off from ears every few minutes (Yes, I tried using all the extra buds in the package). That's just not for me, I have a couple of people in my family who use these and have the same issue.If you're going to buy them to use while jogging or running, they're pretty useless.My verdict? Do yourself a favor and skip these.\\n\", \"\\n  If you are in a rush and immediately purchased it because of high number of reviews, then it's fine. Because when so many people purchase a product it creates an effect in the mind that this must be good, that's why everyone is buying it. But if you have throwly investigated the price bracket for various headphones, you can buy better than this.Why?Base: not premiumDurability : not the best of classSound : very good but not HDI tried Ant audio before this which lasted more than one year. I purchased this now because this was the only competitor and I want to test it for my personal comparison. This is nothing compared to Ant audio.Ant Audio W56 Base is beyond a 7000/- Earphone. It is more strong, Sound is premium and HD, absolute noise cancellation even in Flight seat near wings.I listen to a variety to music from EDM to Hard Rock. This headphone is not an audiophile headphone. But still very good quality sound. But Sound is not enough for my taste Buds.Note : in one month one side stopped working. Now let's see if the replacement is hassle-free or not.\\n\", '\\n  Excellent sound. Really Loud. 30% volume in mobile is enough to make u satisfy with music. The main highlight of this earphone is bass, which can be easily felt. 3sizes of ear ear plugs are given(2 sets each) plus an ear holder. The wires are flat and tangle free. Looks premium and nice. Really durable with metal body. Thanks amazon for giving it @499/- only. Real Pics are given for ur reference.\\n', \"\\n  I bought Boat bass heads 225 yesterday morning. I used this continuously for 2 hours for listening to music and made calls also.During my use in the first day, I found that this headset is awesome. Previously, I was using an AKG headset with USB-C connectivity. Compared to that,I found the sound quality is at par or even better.Things I love:-1. Tangle free.2. L-shaped connecting end.3.

I loved them and thought this 225 will be a better upgrade.So many positive reviews here, hence I bought them.But I returned them the same day.I listen to ALL sub generes of EDM, some heavy metal and some bollywood music too.So I tested this earphones with all of them generes.I used 320kbps mp3s and FLAC files running through a quad DAC from my LG V20 to test this earphones.*SOUND QUALITY**Lows are thumpy and un-natural*Mids are dull*Highs are non-existent, forget clarity*Very un-balanced overall sound*BUILT QUALITY**Great build quality*Very sturdy and premium earcups, seemed durable*Tangle free and a good quality cable*LOOKS**Mine were in Molten Orange colour, looked fantasticTL;DR2/5 for sound quality4/5 for built quality4/5 for looks2.5/5 for value for moneySound quality is the only reason I returned this product. I recommend you to NOT TO BUY this.Choose something from Audio Technica, Senhiser or Sony.Hope this helps. Peace :)\\n', \"\\n  I bought this on 27 august 2018. I used it approx 1 year, but this year on 24 august 2019, the voice gets distorted.. It's an inbuilt problem and there's no physical damage. There's an official website of boat (support.boat-lifestyle.com) here you can claim your product warranty. So I claimed my warranty and next day I got email which shows that my claim is approved, and next day a delivery boy call me for reverse pickup. They replaced my earphone and I got my product back after 23 days (brand new). It tooks time to replace but I am satisfied with this new earphone and after sale service. Love BOAT\\n\", \"\\n  Material quality was sooooooo bad.its been only 2 months and this headset is totally crashed! It started 10 days after I started using.First the songs and videos were changing automatically without doing anything. Calls received using headphones got disconnected automatically.phone volume started changing automatically. This was happening as soon as headset is put on phone. It was frustrating. And now finally one of the mesh/net on headphone is broken while I was cleaning it.plz don't buy it on amazon.they are selling duplicate copies I guess.Did not expected this from Amazon & Boat as my previous headset was durable for more than 6 months which was bought from a proper shop.\\n\", \"\\n  I bought black colour to my brother it works nice. I like that and again I put an order white colour for myself. I received a damaged product (audio jack is slightly bend and doest not fit to my phone) so I return. And put a new order I received again same damaged piece. The I give replacement. In replacement too I received same damaged product. 3 times same damaged products. Later I put refund and don't have idea to have this headset again\\n\", '\\n  Bought this product 2 months back. the earphone was damaged and was not able to hear because of some internal damage near pin. Replaced it with same new product 25 days back and now mic is not working. Such a bad service from boats and amazon. For my bad, i suggested my other two friends to buy the same earphone but now they are also not happy with the product. earphones are good only for few days.\\n', '\\n  3 of us brought this item but what happened with every one of us is that one side of earphone stopped working so we placed a request for repair with the company. They repaired it but again after one year the same issue started to occur again. Now nothing could be done and we had to throw it out.  We went for it because of the price and reviews. If it had not happened to you sooner believe me it will happen to you and you will throw it out under 2 years. The sound is decent, the bass is loud but the sound does not feel that good. If you are strictly on a budget then go for such low priced earphones from any brand. I have used a lot of high-quality earphones and headphones over the last few years and hence I can say that I did not feel that premium or HD sound or whatever you call from this product. This is the case with all the products from any brand under this range. It is not a bad product. I just did not feel the richness in quality after using so many good products.\\n', \"\\n  If you look a pair of cheap good earphone as daily driver and rough usage, no wonder it DID cross your eyes.Me? As Introduction I have a history with with CX180, Piston 3, Rock Zircon in the past. And here goes my review for,'boAt Bass Heads 225 In-Ear Bass Headphones':Pros:1)Sturdy build quality. Hands down one of the best part of this earphone.  The metal and hard plastic finished capsule and the cable are fitted well enough to carry along with you to their work. jogging. travelling etc.2)A pleasant to look at it. I got the red one for me and yes it looks awesome and premium. it stands out quite enough.3)Price:Sound quality ratio. is justified.  I was a bit skeptical over The title on the box 'Super EXTRAAAA Bass' as I don't like 'too much bass' destroying  every other notes of the song/music. But the slight rumbling, extended bass delivered impressed me.  IDK if its for 'Bassheads' but its definitely not for flat listeners.  Soundstage is a bit below average.  The mids and the treble area are straight forward muddy, it doesn't have the sharpness there,  and the identification of individual instruments are muffled. Overall I'd give the sound quality a positive sign obviously  considering the price.4)The single Pause/Play button is embedded into the microphone chasis, so like the entire plastic body part is a  switch, you don't have search for the switch with your thumb.  And thumbs up for the L-shaped 3.5mm jack.5)Lastly, The packing is good. Expect a carrying pouch we get 3 sets of Black earbuds, 3 sells of Red-transparent earbuds.  A clip. Pair of clamp (to support into ear).  Using the black earbuds might provide you a little more comfort but I found the sound gets muffled a bitCons: Now sadly from here on in my review, everything goes downhill upto a really deal breaking point.1)Its UNCOMFORTABLE!!!. it hurts badly in my ear. No matter what earbuds I tried, with or without the clamp or  the clip, it hurts.  Specially when you are on the go, because of its long heavy metallic body of the earpieces.  Ok this experience should not be generalized, as some people out there might find a particular setup to achieve the proper  isolation, fit and comfort. but not me. And I CAN'T recommend this product in that regard.2)Isolation inside ear is poor, and as it hurts you can't put it into ear for long period also.3)The microphone is bad, you always have to keep it close to your mouth even in a relatively less noisy condition.  And no volume rocker.*)The Tangle-free wire is really tangle free but how it feels against the skin (specially when sweaty) is not as comfy as  the braided cable. Its a matter of choice what you like. personally I like the fabric textured braided cable over thisAlready sold this to a friend 2nd hand. So no further updates.Iif anyone is off to look for something else.I'd recommend checking 'Remax RM-610D'. Yes aesthetically and in build quality it might not be in a same level as this one.but it has volume rocker. Way better sound signature and comfortable fit in similar price bracket.\\n\", \"\\n  I have been using Sony MDR-XB55AP since past 2 years and i love it. Being a basshead, i want my earphones/headphones to have good bass. A week back i had gone to my native for vacation and forgot my earphones there. Now i didn't want to take the risk of courier as it might get spoiled on the way.So until my next trip a couple months later i had to make-do with an alternate cheap earphones. was checking out bass earphones under 500 and my eyes fell on this. The reviews were good so i decided to give it a shot. And i was pleasantly surprised to be honest with the sound quality. The bass is good and punchy. The wire is tangle free, and it has a mic too (still to test mic quality). But overall a bargain at the price. If you are a lover of deep punchy bass and want a earphone at a reasonable price go for it. You won't be disappointed.\\n\", \"\\n  No Complaints as far as price to quality goes.Having used much expensive headphones, these are descent enough.(Tested on Laptop and Phones)The Goods:1.Build Quality for the price2.Sturdiness3.Bass(I mean it really just that)4.Ok for Gaming if you tweak it properly with softwares.The Bad:1.Very Suppressed  Vocals( But that can be tweaked to personal Requirements using softwares)[i used Sonic Studio]2.Using Continuously for long hours(3-4) may cause pain in ears.I mean that's it.I think for the price it comes at , their's not much to complain about.\\n\", '\\n  There is too much hissing sound in the earphone, initially I thought that the particular piece which I received has some defect so I replaced it but the second time when I got the other piece then again I found the same issue which make me realise that there is some quality issue in the earphone.And another thing which I disliked about the earphone and I also found many other people complaint about it is that it regularly fell out of the ear.Though the voice is quite loud and bass is also very good.I generally avoid giving total negative review but this time I am giving such a review because I am really very disappointed by the product, I am not saying that boat product is not good infact I am using boat 220 earphone which is quite good, so it is just about this particular model\\n', \"\\n  I always used to buy which ever earphones were lower in price and assumed those were good.  They used to give trouble after some time.  Worst was when speakers work fine but mic goes bad and we won't realize until the person on the other end keeps asking us to repeat :)This earphones with mic from boAt is so good where I bought it by chance when my previous earphones failed.  I realized this is too good for its price.  Clarity of speakers is fantastic and the mic is also great.  I use this not just for listening to music but use this for conference calls and singing too.  Now that we have online classes for school kids, I bought a second one recently for my kid.\\n\", '\\n  Boat earphones has never disappointed me and this earphone which I bought is very cool. Starting from the color to the sound quality is to die for.The colour attracted me the most. Previously I had this earphones in black color. So this time I thought of buying this in blue colour.No complains...Keep it up Boat#tuneintonirvana\\n', \"\\n  Best earphones in this price range. Lookout for offers and discounts as price of this item fluctuates. This is my second buy of this same product. The previous one lasted for 2 years and one side stopped working,impressed, I bought it again.Pros:Good bass.Excellent clear and good sound quality.There is a balance between all the sounds.Extremely durable flat cable which is tangle free, this comes in handy if you commute by train/bus a lot.The pause and play button is also of good quality and will last long.Can be used for calling as a hands-free or for youtubers for recording audio as well.It records nice quality audio with good noise cancellation considering its price.Additional earbuds make sure that it can be used buy people having either bigger or smaller ears.The gold plated 3.5 mm jack is also sturdy and well attached with the cable.Cons:I am not a sound and headphone expert but I feel there is a little distortion above 75% volume. Its more than enough for regular usage and light gaming as well.The only con I would say is that they could have included previous song button alongwith the play/pause button. I am not deducting any stars for this one, it's only I wish it had.Note: many people say that its heay as its made of metal and falls of often. For that problem they have included the silicon hooks which comes with the box itself you just need to attach thise silicon hooks and they would stick to your ears for eternity.\\n\", '\\n  I have bought 3 pairs , one for me and 2 other for colleagues.Even today one of my colleague ordered one.  sound quality is good and it has a tanglefree flat cord which is its USP\\n', \"\\n  These earphone have really good sound quality but the earbud design is very poor and uncomfortable. Even after trying multiple earbud sizes given in package it still doesn't feel comfortable. The metallic design is the primary culprit for this problem. Its too big and feel heavy on ears and keeps falling out. Also its just straight like rod without any tilt to adjust with ear angle unlike most earphones which do come woth little tilt to easily fit in ears.\\n\", '\\n  I wanted a wired earphones to attend my meetings since my JBL bluetooth earphones are not good at that. While I was researching for wired earphones, I came across this and felt it could be the one that I am looking for.Firstly, the built quality is superb with metallic finish and tangle-free cable which is really a good deal at this price. However the sound quality was little low when compared with my JBL earphones which costs Rs. 2000/-, 4 times higher than this. Bass was just okay which I felt can be improved as these earphones were tagged as \"bassHeads\". Because of the sound quality and bass, I rated a 4-star.If you are looking for a good sound quality with high bass, then I would recommend you to refrain from purchasing this product which will disappoint you for sure. Since I just bought this to attend my meetings and not for any other use, I am not thinking to return this.\\n', '\\n  These earphones also get really loud but will only appeal to a certain set of buyers. If you are a basshead who enjoys a thump in your music, these earphones are good for the price they command. If you prefer a neutral or a bright sound, these are not for you.ProsExcellent build qualityBundled earhooksCan get loudConsOversensitive microphoneBass overpowers mids and highsRatings (out of 5)Design/ comfort: 4Audio quality: 2.5Value for money: 3.5Overall: 3.5\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality, noise cancelation is extremely good and the bass drops so hard that you wouldn't believe it.But the major flaw with this headphones is that they have added an unnecessary long tube, causing the speaker portion stick out far from your ear, because of which, it keeps falling of out of ears.They have included many tools to make it stay in your ears, but still it fails to stay in the ear. ( I had read this from other reviewers, but I didn't think that it was a serious issue, but in fact it was a serious issue)I had to think 5-6 times before returning it(cuz of amazing sound quality).\\n\", \"\\n  let's get inPros :1) Treble - 3.5/5 (very suppressed trebles )2) Bass - 4.5/5 ( it's a very over powering bass ) *please do understand difference between bass and loudness*3) Mids - 4/54) wire quality is good5) earphones shell are of some cheap metal alloy# well loudness is there to this 90+dB means a lot actually , for the bass people here the bass is good but it's not rich what that means is there's no clean bass it's a mix of mids and bassCons:1) Left Earphones die like that ( experienced n seen for 8 such earphones that include mine and friends)2) Buttons malfunction at times#Not for the guys who want to listen acoustic and natural equilised music it turns every lower Hz to almost full bar so it steals the real clarity# Go for it if you want it for a casual listening not a precise sound output as it won't give you one\\n\", '\\n  Earphone will give you extra sound if wire will shake :( and always you have to push earphone into ear as it will slip out after some time very irritating not comfortable as well. So go for which ease your ear. think too much as its 500 bucks. Material is some what not tempting but sound will win over it. Go for it I have purchased 2 unit\\n', \"\\n  Product is very very GoodCompare to redmi basic & samsung Esh64This earphones have 16ohm impedance  (other have 32ohm) so what its mean? U can get extra loud sound with half of volume  its also battery saving because you mobile amplifier don't need to give too much signal.Now talk about soundSound is balanced (not bass better than redmi basic but definitely better than ESH64)QUALITY OF VOCAL & MUSIC IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER EARPHONE! YOU CAN HEAR EVERY INSTRUMENTS SOUND IN THISbut not too much bass (i am not using viper4android)Call quality best, mic quality is also very good  you don't need to put mic in near mouthBulid quality is little heavy (wire have some weight )  but its good for rough handlingSERVICE OR WARENTY CLAIM OF BOAT COMPANY IS EXTREMELY SATISFIED SO YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT.Because i  already used warrenty claim & replaced my old boat earphone & they replaced..This is My honest review& I love❤️ boAt..& hope u will be too 😊😊\\n\", \"\\n  what do you expect from earphones ? It ain't gonna make your head a home theatre.- it has good bass- sound quality is pretty good- Design is sturdy fits into ear properly (now if you're gonna run and jump like a mad buffalo any earphone will fall down irrespective of its design so kindly excuse that)- ideal for daily routine use I usually connect with laptop/walking track so works for meOverall a decent product with just above average sound quality so yea the boat sails good !\\n\", \"\\n  The sound is fairly good. The reason I am writing this review is to highlight the robustness of the earphones. I had accidentally washed my trousers with the earphones still inside the pocket. When I realised it, I dried them in sunlight for quite some time. Although the right one wasn't working for a few days, the worked perfectly fine after about 15 days of leaving out in the open to completely dry, even though they're not mentioned to be waterproof. It could qualify as a stress test. The flat wire and structure makes sure that the wire casing doesn't rip at obvious and recurring bends in the wire. Worthy of the money paid.\\n\", \"\\n  works great, sounds great, high mids all good , nicely tuned , base is also there significant , much better than boult or ant audio, mic works well , although new versions are less durable as my old ones are stronger than the new one's (this one) i bought for my dad. Clearly, there are some compromises being made while price increased. So for no noise cancellation and low value for money it stops from being perfect but still lies in considerate lineup especially compared to competition.\\n\", \"\\n  This headphones doesn't last for a month also. the one code stopped working 2-3 days back and now the second one is also losing it sound. I purchased this headphones on 22nd jul 2019 and today being the 22nd Aug 2019. Just a one month.I am totally disappointed with this product.\\n\", '\\n  I can say its a Average headset, the headset package was already opened when i got it. I took a risk and tried the headset. Some one might have returned it since the Sound and Bass is not up to the mark.Pros-----Headset wire is flat which makes it tangle free and long lasting.Cons-----1. I find the ear bud hard to put in, also it keeps on falling, only the small buds was suitable for me but it also keeps falling if you try to get up or move around.I would recommend seeing Sameer patil user review which is in the top 10 before buying this since each user have their own need.\\n', '\\n  This was my second purchase of this earphone. This time mic stopped working after 32 days of billing, means 30 days of regular daily 8-9 hrs use. Even in last earphone right ear stopped working after 5 months and after repair/replacement by Boat, again stopped working in both year after 13 months. Whatever it offers is zero if we get the worst durability.\\n', \"\\n  product is absolutely awesome when it comes to music and bass. What I didn't like was that there is no volume up and down option available and also the weight of the earphones are slightly on the higher side because the set up is made of metal. Right and left are not highlighted but written in the same color of the earphone which made it difficult to identify. The mic side is left which we should always bear in mind. Overall good but volume up and down is a key feature which this misses on lastly its a Made in China product which I am ashamed to see now.\\n\", \"\\n  Firstly the built quality is top notch love the tangle free design cable and L shaped jack coming to the sound is where i was a little disappointed the quality of bass and overall sound was noticeably lacking.. But for this orice range i can't asl for much its mediocre sounding not too bad not great either.. Good for people who just like balanced sound stage! Mic quality was superb took some calls no complaints whatsoever.. I would say overall a descent product for r its price..!\\n\", '\\n  Though the sound quality is good, not comfortable at all. Very heavy, after couple of minutes it irritates you. Not suitable, if you are planning to watch movie or not even for phone calls. I tried JBL, Sony, Sennheiser, Boat in ear headphones, but personally I like Sony and JBL only.\\n', \"\\n  I have bought these earphones on Diwali sale at 500 rupees but I am not satisfied with it because it doesn't fit in my ears,even not in anyone elses.The main problem is that the portion that fits into ears are made up of metal so because it is heavy it doesn't fit in ears .so because of these problems of their customers they are providing some rubber adjustment that help it to fix into ears but than also it is not a good solution because after 5 minutes of continuous wearing these my ears star paining .So I recommend you to not to buy it but if you ask me about it's quality, it is really good and bass is also good but I think these things doesn't matter if you can't wear it properly .\\n\", \"\\n  I am reviewing this product after 1.5 years of usage,so just,stay on with mePROS:-Sound quality is very good,even after so many days,it sounds like the original one-The TANGLE-FREE cable keeps its promise, doesn't tangle at all unless,you seriously take it a challenge XD-The build quality is good, hasn't developed any crack or other issues.-The various ear buds provided,helps you select the most comfortable one for your ear-The metallic buds are quite relevantCONS:-First of all,the colour will fade after 1 years of continuous usage,kinda looks dull afterwards-The Yellow colour is conspicuous,yet gets dirty easily,and there's no remedy unless you consider dry washing as an option (lol)OVERALL NICE PRODUCT,NO COMPLAINTS\\n\", \"\\n  HIGHLY DURABLE!!!I bought this product on 20 November 2016 and have been using it since then.It just stopped working today on 13 August 2020. Reordered the same one again.Pros :>Quality of material is really amazing and high premium quality wire.>Extra ears buds in various sizes as an extra accessories feels really soft to ears which is good for long hours usage without any irritation, feels very comfortable>Amazing base,beats, great and powerful output sound quality>Tangle free wire in flat shaped that's another great feature>Head set cups made of metals for amazing performance and longer durabilityCons:>Driver unit is a little bit heavy But for me it doesn't create a problem because I have used this product for more than 3 year.>Vocal could be more clear.My overall opinion-This product is durable and 200% worth the money\\n\", \"\\n  Edit: Having used it for a month now. I just tossed it into trash can for not performing as expected and the ergonomics are way off. Simply not suited for wearing beyond 15mins. This product is overwhelmingly overrated.40 thousand plus reviews with 4 stars got me thinking this must be really good.  For the price it over-delivers what it offers. But this is something not meant even for a novice audiophiles. The bass on it is quiet over powered unless it's toned done via an EQ. But still doesn't help for anything else like using it for calls, listening to vocals, movies or even games. This is best suited for those bass oriented ballywood and bojpuri songs which makes your head explode. It's in the same league of those aweful Skullcandy, beats and Sony. Over all, it's a well rounded package in terms of bass performance and nothing else\\n\", '\\n  Not worth the money, I have been using these earphones for more than 6 months now. So, however the earphones are not that bad in sound and built quality, but I could not get a good piece of earphones even after 2 replacements.First thing, they are not compatible with all android phones, so do check the compatibility before buying.Second thing, In my first delivery, i got a damaged piece in which mike was not working, so I got them replaced, after using them for 2 months, mike of this pair has also stopped working.third thing, they keep falling off your ears (May be because earphones are heavy as they are made of metal), so if you are a sort of person who bangs his head while listening to your favorite music, these are not for you, they fall off with slightest jerk in wire.\\n', \"\\n  The product i received was packed very nicely ro avoid any damages to item.Now let's talk about earphonesBoat 225 model is quite nice when we talk about bass in silent room but when you are traveling these headphones doesn't work on same setting you need to increase the volume almost to make to have clear cut audio experience plus the earphones doesn't stuck in ear which is new issue.Though if you aren't a regular traveller like me you won't feel any issue.Best for normal usage or budget issues.\\n\", \"\\n  Just before I start, I have tried this, soundmagic es18, cowon em1 which are just a 100 or two more than this. But they sound good for their price. The boat team has compromised heavily with sound quality just to price this a bit cheaper than its competitors. The sound is totally unbalanced to begin with, the bass is just overpowering the vocals, and it's not even good bass, it's muddy and all over the place.  Althought the build quality is staunch but I wouldn't compromise it for the sub-standard sound quality. Don't buy them, please, unless you are okay with horrible sound.\\n\", \"\\n  The built quality of the earphone is amazing as per the price. If you are an EDM lover and listen to rock music then I highly recommend you to buy this. But, if you love to listen to songs with vocals then this might disappoint you a bit not completely cause it sounds better than most of the 2k earphones.I bought the blue colour and it looks awesome my brothet has the red one... So, you can choose either of them and look cool.. That's all,  thanks for reading..\\n\", '\\n  At this price range this is the best product for bass lovers,its wired one so no charging  and discharging  worries,  its comes with 1 year warranty with warranty  card inside the box. Its comfortable on your ears for 3 hours (personal experience) after that you will experience little pain, overall good music experience  with this earphones just be aware of the fake product. You can watch videos on you tube to differentiate  between original and fake product. I did that so I know the difference i wanted everyone who r buying these earphones  should  get original  product  and good music  experience .Bass = 8/10Comfort =8/10Durability = 9/10Tangle free cable=yes\\n', '\\n  Please don\\'t buy this product. The left speaker stopped working before my first month was even over.Total wast of money.I think I should have invested more and bought from JBL or Sony.Very bad customer care service. The number given in the box doesn\\'t work. Every time I call on the number, it says \"Wrong number\".No reply for the email sent by me even.Don\\'t be foolish and buy this product you will be sorry if you do.\\n', \"\\n  Just a beast!! ...Being a music producer ,I've tried to extend its level for the fullest 👀I've tried to mix and master out many songs with it!.. and VOILA!  .. they sounded so real  ..Each and every frequency could be heard !Which is not expected at this price range❤️It's just ... Don't know what to say! ..I've Sennheiser professional headphones which cost me ~$100 ..I monitored both and there wasn't much difference!A must buy thing on amazon !\\n\", '\\n  If you are a Electronic Music lover.. Then i recommend Skullcany jib versions. Boat does not deliver the promised bass.. Audio have too much  treble makes it sound unclear at times and hurts ears even at lower volume due to high frequencies.. After using Skullcany for 3 years now i never faced any problems like this.. The ear buds sometimes block the audio in boat .. Only the build quality is good over skullcandy and rest of the elements.. Skullcandy is the best.. Delivers excellent bass and audio clarity and quality.. Without hurting ears at louder volume and ear bud fit well!I myself edm Producer so i know how it should sound like.. But if u are someone who listens to music less often but uses only for calls then its goodHope this helps thank you\\n', '\\n  This was very initial impressions ill update this review later or follow me.Bass was excellent amazingAnd all other sounds unable to say but they are average or above average as said this is initial impressionsI am using LG G7 thinQ so volume is treated as 75 is full when i exceed 50 this earphones distort heavily and cant be used at high level but at 50 i am ok with it it definitely distort at higher volumes but you will nit use at higher volumes bcoz it satisfies your hearing at 50% to 70% only. after all the bass vocals mids and treble goes digitally high and distort its not good to hear tooAnd it has passive noise cancellation tooMostly this earphones depends on quality output of 3.5mm audio jack for my lg g7 it has quad dac so its the beast of powering any headphone in the market\\n', '\\n  This headset is not so great at the same time not poor also...sound quality is really good but when put it in my ear I feel the rough surface of headset is little annoying...and not feel the comfort level as I compare it the Skullcandy headset I never faced any such things and more over I bought this boat for my voice recording in smile plat form but after recording the voice am very disappointed....as compare to Skullcandy its much much better than this.... anyway no point in talking about voice recording...as these are meant for listening music...if you are only going to use it for music then big thumbs up...but see the comfort level for your ears...\\n', '\\n  Superrrrrrbbbb Headphone Frm BOAT.

Bass is great.3. Noise cancellation is also great.Dislikes:The earbuds! None of the sizes were right for my ears. They are too big and keeps popping off my ears. The worst being that I cannot use a smaller earbud too as the design is customised. Other earbuds don't fit in this earphones.\\n\", \"\\n  I had initially received a damaged product and amazon replaced it without hassle. The packaging is neat and compact, comes with all the 3 sizes of earbuds in two colours so you get a total of 6 pairs of them.The product in itself is decent and worth the price paid. Now we can't expect the bass and noise cancellation of the high end over the ear headphones that cost at least 10x more. The button at the mouthpiece starts and stops music and disconnects calls efficiently. The flat cord ensures that you don't tangle the headphones as much as you otherwise would have (it's a huge pro for me cause I personally suck at untangling wires.) It overall looks and performs way better than the other earphones at this price point. So if your budget is under ₹500/- I'd suggest you get these without hesitation.\\n\", '\\n  The sound quality is quite fine. The mid, bass and lows are balanced enough and sound clarity is good. Only one issue I found is the earpiece / earbud shape and size, it has the habit of falling off. The lengthof the cable too is on bit longer side. Have tried many earphones, both cheap and costlier ones, this oneis better one of them at this price point. Bought Ant Audio W56 wired earphone too along with this one and found Ant Audio was bit better.\\n', \"\\n  I bought this headphone15th  june 2018.but after 4-5 months its stop working.then i call service center for replacement and file a complain.Then after few days i submit the falty headphone to their delivary boy...after 15days they give me a new one it's working properly.but after 4-5 months in 12th july,2019 it was stop working again but this time i didn't claim replacement because warranty period is over.this is why i don't think it is a good product.exept this it is a good product in a affordable price..for 4-5 months.i think this is why it is a wast of money.\\n\", '\\n  Bought them for 599 INRBoat bassheads are ones that i bought for my friends i bought two of them and tested them beforehand Following were the best of this• Powerful bass• Crisp Sound• Little bit Surround Sound• And Balanced audio even after powerful bassIf you have buget go for them But If they are around 600 INR Try JBL C200 or C100 one with the same price....During Offers.\\n', \"\\n  I'm writing this review after using this earphones for 1 year. It was working well for 1 year and 1 month one side earpiece stopped working and I can't able to claim warranty also but that 1 year it's working quiet well and the bass is also soooo good actually I'm a bass lover so only I bought this earphones. It's a good earphones to buy I'm not saying that it will stop working after 1 year my friends are using it still now 2 to 3 year it's life vary on the way how you handle it that's it then after that I bought boAt rockerz 510 on ear headphones and it's also working quiet will and the bass is killing good at full volume your ear will  start to vibrate. I think I'm writing two products reviews in one place (lol). . . .Have a niceday. . . .\\n\", '\\n  Received the earphone in good condition.Got this in a deal and is definitely worth the bucks.One problem is that it is too loud and causes pain after using it for a time.\\n', \"\\n  I don't understand why people buy these. Thesr hurt a lot when put in ear. Also, probably most of the people who bought and reviewed it 5 star haven't heard what real bass is. I'd recommend everyone to buy Panasonic's ₹700 earphones which do way way more justice to the price. In fact those have been my favourites since 2012. I have used two before and after listening to these so called bassheads, I returned these and re-ordered Panasonic and Oh God! The sound quality still stands out.\\n\", '\\n  It looks really good. Acceptable sound quality. However, it is very heavy, badly designed and easily slides off from the ears whichever bud you use. It is very important to have some sort of locking mechanism for heavy earphones. This one has black spurs provided alongwith which are supposed to be some sort of locking mechanism. However, it is a mere gimmick and doesnot offer any locking whatsoever. I will give it the title \"most poorly designed product of the year\". I regret purchasing it and had to get another as it won\\'t sit in the ear even for 5 minutes on its own.\\n', '\\n  Packing was great and as mentioned all things were there within box.the earphones have good Sound quality andBetter Noise cancellation but After 15 days of use the earphone was working properly but the mic was not working properly as whenever i used to contact with others while using this earphone the reciever receives rusty noise while taking, then i tested with other earphones they were working well.So buying this product was just waste of money for me ,insted i has to buy a local earphone which is still working properly.\\n', '\\n  boAt Bass Heads 225 in-Ear Bass Headphones with One Button Mic (Red) - It come in many colors including vibrant red. It has really nice sound quality and good bass. It is equally good for listening to music from youtube or gaana or wink music. Also it is equally effective with telephonic calls or official teleconferences. I connect it with my mobile to listen to music or while watching movies through Netflix, or Prime Video, or Google Movies. Also I use it to connect to my office laptop for taking calls during meetings. I highly recommend one to use this product as it is versatile and delivers what it promises.\\n', \"\\n  The boat has established and proved itself as a promising and reliable Indian brand. It has launched some very affordable as well as very well built products lately. These earphones are no joke either. The very first thing I liked about these earphones is the build. The cable is flat and made of good quality rubber material. Earphones are metallic and are heavy thus feel very sturdy and durable. Also, the sound is very good. It has got superb Bass, and equally good trebles & vocals. These are cheaper compared to other expensive and reputed brands and even then it maintains an impressive balance between build and sound quality. It has even got a Mic and call pick/drop button which is a bonus at this price. Compared to the Sennheiser's CX180 (which has no Mic/button and very cheap built) and JBL's C100si (average build and Little expensive), these are a much better option.\\n\", \"\\n  This may be a problem with not just this earphone but all boAt earphones. Till they work, they work fine. But if there is any problem, well, you are on your own. The is no after sales customer support.I had another boAt earphone which worked fine for about six months. Then it started giving problem. I tried their service centre, but they were not really helpful. Any way I was happy with the sound quality so decided to give it another chance thinking that may be my earlier piece was defective. This time it lasted longer, but same problem again. One side simply stopped working. As far as after sales customer support is considered, there doesn't seem to be any improvement. Even after a month of registering my complaint, I have yet to receive any communication from them.\\n\", '\\n  This is the second time i am buying this headset, superb bass, excellent build quality and tangle free wire, i have dropped it so many times, the head is metal, my previous headset still works fine,if you are looking for headset in this price range, this is the best one for you, better than jbl c100.The only problem you might face would be the pin (3.5mm) would become loose after frequent use\\n', \"\\n  Great Sound but they keep falling off, hence 3 Stars.Pros-------1. Great Sound, no two ways about it. Lovely sound and noise cancellation effects.2. length of the wire is goodCons-------1. Keeps falling off - balance is off, Weight of the Earphones and weight of the wire pincher with the BOAT logo is heavy and they pulling the earphone down.2. The small handle projections at the base of the earphone from where the wire comes out are projected outwards which pulls it down as well.3. Esp. when you are walking and running the earphones will fall off, only good for listening while you are static and don't move your head.4. Not fully tangle free, in spite of the flat wires, they get tangled sometimes\\n\", \"\\n  1-The Audio quality of these headphones is really good compares to others in this price range. Boat promised what they say out of box ‘ Extraaaa Bass’,2- the Bass of these headphones are really high compared to others. An overall the sound output of this headphones are very high.3- I found these headphones have good audio quality compare to others at this price.4-If you like EDM and pop songs, then you love these Boat headphones. But I suggest reducing a volume of your phone while listening Sufi and romantic songs because by default these headphones have higher volume, so you don't feel clear audio.5-The once again Bass effect is really good with treble and vocal. You can easily distinguish between different instruments & sounds which are good for extra bassy headphones.After review and comparison with other headphones, I say the Boat boAt BassHeads 225/200/228/220 is the best headphones in price comparison. It has a solid build quality, good performance, low price, and more important extreme Bass. I highly recommend these headphones for Bass lovers & budget-conscious people who are looking for high quality & durable earphones at a reasonable price.\\n\", '\\n  I am reviewing this product after 8 months. I really liked the sound quality of it when I purchased it at first, but as time passed, the constant issue of adjusting the earbud drove me crazy. It is too heavy and keeps sliding off your ears and trust me, those ear supports do not work as they are extremely painful, slip off when you are running and you cannot listen to them while sleeping on your side. The most important thing is the durability which sucks as one of my earbuds stopped working after 8 months and I cannot claim my warranty as I have lost my card. The sound quality is extremely good and one of the best if you like great bass. It kind of distorts the beauty of old melodious songs, however. It is a good choice if you prefer listening in a rested position. Make sure to retain all the contents of the original box.\\n', \"\\n  Not much to say except they work great, quality is good. Nothing I can really complain about. Reasonable price for such a great sound. Loving every minute I’m listening to something in these! I haven't bought a lot of high-end (high-price) in ear headphones, but this one is far & away the best I have ever heard and owned. And the price makes it a fantastic value (and no, I am not a 'bot' or associated with BOAT , just a very satisfied customer - your mileage may vary) I haven't owned it long enough to comment on durability, but am extremely pleased with it so far. Very comfy, can't really tell I have them in. They seem to slip out a little when I'm outside in the heat. My guess it's because of the sweat.I highly recommend this product...\\n\", \"\\n  Super fast delivery by Amazon. Received package in excellent condition. As for the headphones, it's absolutely mind-blowing. The sound output is just awesome. The Crystal clear sound with extra bass is just super. The package also contains extra earbuds and a clip. Design wise this headphone is light-weight and has flat tangle-free cable which makes it extremely durable. I am extremely happy with this and I'm loving it!\\n\", \"\\n  The boat bassheads 225 has good built quality as well as very rich sound quality. Due to the 10mm audio drivers the bass is good at high volumes.The company claims that the 1.2m flat cable is tangled free and have sogle button for controls which means it's unable to control volume levels. The ear piece is made of metal which give rich feeling whereas make it a bit heavy and after long usage it is a bit painfull. Is such a price range it's a great deal and specially for people looking high bass . The product is value for the money spent on it.\\n\", \"\\n  This is a nice product from boat. First of all boat provides 1 year warranty form any part in india. If you claim warranty in Boat website they will pick up your order by courier and replacement new unit will be sent to you within two weeks maximum, you don't have to go anywhere. This is perfect for Bass lovers, clarity of sound is nice but not at the top. It is quite heavy in the ear as it is metal finish. If you adjust the proper air burds then it will not fall from ear.\\n\", '\\n  I had used boat wired earphone before, based on that experience I have taken chance to buy this. Unfortunately, this time it does not worth it because of the following reasons:-1) Never stays in ear, even for a simple head roation or little jerk will make earphone to fall from ears, really pathethic and I have even tried with all the bud sizes dilevered along with the box. It does not make any sense when the earphones wont stay on your ear, its absoulte useless and I am surpised to so many postivie review despite such malfunction.2) Sound/Audito clarity is poor and quality is not as expected which really upsets, voice call clairty is even bad.Only best part thing is the length of the chord and flat wires seems to be of good quality.Overall, I wont recommend anyone to buy this, absoulte useless.\\n', '\\n  Overall boat Bassheads 225 looks premium feels premium and also last like a premium headphones does.Earphone plugs are smooth not at all irritating (\"material quality\")Sound quality is pretty much good and not the best what you get in high end earphonesBut for this money these earphones seals the dealCall receiving button is cleverly placedBut one down side is the earpods keeps falling of from ears because they are little bit heavy apart from that its a score!Unfortunately this earphone stopped working after a week of my purchase I\\'ve sent it back to boat customer service itself they\\'ve taken forever to send a replacement item totally disappointed with this product\\n', '\\n  Note-Totaly unbiased opinion.Used both of them before,if you want earphone for bass only then you can go for boat bassheads 225 (realme is just behind boat)but for overall sound quality go for realmeUsed boat before definitely have to face problem in its comfort😒😒BASSBoat(4.5/5),realme(4.3/5)realme bass thumping feels good but not as high as that of boat.SOUND QUALITYBoat(4.0/5),Realme(4.5/5)Realme all things are good balancedCOMFORTBoat(3.6/5)Realme(4.5/5)when use Boat for long duration it creates headache 😑😑DURABILITYBoat(5/5),Realme(4.8/5)Boat gets an advance of l shaped connector which makes it more durable.Wire quality of realme is better than that of boat.In my opinion you should go for realme buds 2\\n', \"\\n  The overall build quality is excellent. It will not tangle and cause that irritation. Wires are thick enough and it won't get damaged due to any accidental stretch.The loudness is good and music gets crisp and clear. Though bass is low. One might need to configure the Equaliser. If one listens to various genres of music then this setting won't help.In this price segment it is still the best choice. One gets various buds to fit in the ear and a pair of ear holder as well.The packaging done by Amazon was good and it had no damages.\\n\", \"\\n  the boat service is amazing...i filed a complaint regarding replacement and they provided replacement after 8months of buying...they are one of the best in class for bass.... everyone must consider this under 600rs...amazing service...build quality is not excellent but if you keep it safe ,it will last longer......1more piston are the only ones which are slightly better than this but they are on bit costly side plus they don't have flat tangle free wire...if you want to try for bass then bassheads 225 are made for u and if u want trebles then 1more piston fit will be better...i mean under 1000 these 2 earphones are beast..\\n\", '\\n  I have been using this Headphone since long.Intitially ordered this during 2017...Consinuously used this on daily basis for more than 2 years and then it started malfunctioning.earlier, I had used headsphones of other reputed brands, but, this only withstand long rough usage on daily basis...I have again ordered the same model 225, since I am hugely satisfied with the performance and durability.Pros:Ear Pods are of Metal - Ensuring DurabilityFlat Cable: Tangle Free OperationBass : 10/10 (at this price range)Sound Clarity: 9/10Cons:Ear Pods are a bit heavy, since metalicCable length is loo long, sometimes, hard to manage such long lengthif we ignore these smalls cons, reast everything is simply superb.Just use it for once, it will make you a repeat purchaser...\\n', '\\n  Got this from sale for 300 bucks.Cons-1. Wire is too thick, Although its tangle free but it your ears will feel the weight of wires when you are using this headphones while walking. Feels like it will just come out and you end up in sliding it into your ears now and then.2. Sound quality is best at low volumes. At high volumes you dont hear beats clearly. Listening this ear phones at high volumes is not recommended unless you care for your ears3.

But any way if you love boat than go for it otherwise don't buy these earphones because i was also fan of boat but now I'll not suggest these earphones\\n\", \"\\n  I purchased this earphone in the month of March 2019, today its almost 1 year and trust me the sound Quality is as awesome as it was on the day one.- We are buying this gadget because we want to feel the real sound, we want to get isolated from other things and trust me kuch sunayi nahi deta isko lagaane ke bad(Total noice cancellation).- No. Of times i dropped/mis-handelled my earphone but the build quality is so good you don't have to worry about.- Im using it in my Mobile/Laptop/PC/Home Theatre 3.5 outletThank you. Buy it.\\n\", '\\n  TL; DR: This is the worst product I have ever ordered from Amazon.  Don’t buy this.Pros:1. Sound quality is satisfactory and bass is optimum.2. Wire is tangle free.Cons: (And this is really big)1. The design is NOT AT ALL ergonomic and DOES NOT hold onto ears. Forget being comfortable, it will hurt your ears and will keep slipping from the ear.  (Do not buy this at all as it is non-returnable and can only be replaced)2.It is heavy and thus helping even more in the above point.I can’t stress enough by saying that don’t go for this product. There are much better products out there.\\n', '\\n  They worked for exactly 4 monthsI bought the headphones on 11th april and by 12th august, only one headphone was workingBoth sides of the earphones dont have the little seive inside anymore, as in i can see the speaker base insidet he earphoneThe bass is good for a few weeks buthwn it gets too loudNow, for the right earphone, it works only if i hold ut at a very specific angle , which is not possible because i was using these earphones for gaming and watching videos\\n', \"\\n  Mi earphones are better than this but then again nothing can compete with its durability. Listening Music is all good but can't be used for long duration as ear starts to pain. I don't want to get to details. You will find a lot of it in the reviews but what I want to point is the durability. By far the best durable earphone. Keep it in any condition and it will work just fine. Noice cancellation is not there so a bummer in public transport but that can be ignored if you turn up the volume a little high say around 70.\\n\", \"\\n  While this won't be any audiophile's favorite, the build quality can survive daily rough usage. Pretty good economic option if you want to use it during your daily workout or dealing with the chaos of road traffic without worrying if it will be damaged by sweat.Recommended buy if available at around Rs 400 (net effective price). For anything higher than that, I would suggest looking for a mid-range Sony or Sennheiser alternative.\\n\", \"\\n  It's been 2yrs since purchased. Still boom sound as I maintain my accessories with care. Sound quality is just exceptional for the price range. I wear them upside down with the help of the provided clip for ample comfort. I don't use earhooks. Bass is solid & thumping. Doesn't feel any dampness or amplification at any volume level. Just pure thumping sound.One thing that I wished is that I should be able to use them while resting. They are just fine in as long as I am sitting or walking, but while resting, they tend to create discomfort even in the upside down position inserted in the ears. & only due to this reason, I sometimes begin searching for other earphones. While writing this review, I have favourited Sennheiser C275s in my wish list, so thought to express my feelings for Boat Bassheads 225 too.\\n\", \"\\n  The earphone just arrived and I was astonished by the packaging and quality of the product. The packaging is really very good. It won't let you feel about the low price of the product.Previously, I always used to prefer Sony earphones only. My last one was MDR-XB70 which is a very expensive one. But the sound quality was good enough to make you feel proud about the money spent on them. Undoubtedly, my ears are habituated to quality sound and bass output. The Sony earphone is not working right now and I'm a bit out of budget for an expensive alternative. After days of research and analysis, I took a risk and gave BOAT 225 Bass Heads a shot.After connecting it to my phone I was utterly mesmerised by the sound quality it is offering at this price point. Trust me, I'm a bit sceptical about these things. The price is too low to be compared to other high-quality earphones out there in the market. The bass output is awesome. The highs are not that well balanced but considering the price, it's just an awesome product. The build quality is great and you can't expect more. It's true that the earphones are heavy and will tend to come out. The ear tips provided with the earphones are very hard and not at all comfortable. My previous ear tips from Sony came handy in this situation. Thus, I'm saved ;P.Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend these earphones if you love bass and have really very low budget like me.\\n\", \"\\n  All good... Boat, Amazon & Seller, good job! Awesome perfect BLUE color, in Love, Cool!Got it for 500, worth the money, best in the range!!!Good wire quality, also the flat cable & Great Bass, nice vocals & noise cancellation, etc etc etc with all music genres!The only drawback is since the ear pieces are a light metal, it sometimes easily comes out of the ears due to its weight, but no worries as the clips are provided it manages things, but still can't go for long hours.Finally, its BEST for the PRICE. Comfortable and Happily you can buy it!\\n\", '\\n  The product is definitely worth the price and is a worthy addition to my backpacking gear. The bass is really strong and you can straightaway feel it. The only thing I disliked was,in order to keep the balance, the highs have been pushed up a bit too far IMO. It highs sounds like the old tweeters that we used to use. Bringing the highs down a touch should improve the sound. Still, I think its one hellaway thing at this price point.\\n', \"\\n  i bought 3 earphones and jbl's 799/- and boats 599/- and 499/- this one being the midrange among these three.. was the worst one. boats 499/- was much much better and comfortable than this .This is also too big and uncomfortable for the ears. It keeps coming off. Though it might look good in pics but I'll say go for other 2 as per ur budget and avoid buying this one.It doesn't hav return option also.. only replacement is available.. as i would hav bought another jbl instead of this\\n\", \"\\n  Sound quality is ok.I have noticed the following down points.1. The quality of the material is not good, it's not friction proof, every time due to friction with shirt or cloth the earphone come out of the ear.2.The material used for making the wire is quite heavy and because of it's weight the earphone pulls out of the ears.3.The wire of the earphone is quite big and it's become difficult to adjust the same.4. Due to it's build quality and lengthy wire it's become very uncomfortable to wear the earphone and every time you have to adjust the earpiece.And one more thing the cable is not Tangle FreeOVER ALL ITS CHEAP AT THIS PRICE, BUT POOR ON COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE AND WILL CERTAINLY DISTURB UR LIFESTYLE\\n\", \"\\n  Ear plug is not fit in ears. Again and again it comes out from ear. I tried other size of given plug in cover. But no luck. None of them fit properly. So, not for work out of course.Sound quality is not bad. But main problem it is not stable when you will wear in ear. So I am not happy with this product.I used sony, schenizer, none of them I didn't face such issue. But bot disappointed me.My personal opinion don't go for this. If you want I'll request please check the issue what I have faced.\\n\", \"\\n  The product as the name says, is bass heavy. Thise who loves bass would totally love these headphones. The overall sound quality, especially treble and mids are a bit weak, but that's because its bass heavy.So, if you are more interested in bassy output and dont care much about other things, do go for it.The built quality is kind of good, but the metal casing does feel a bit heavy in ears. The flat cables are great as they are a bit thick and doesnt tangle a lot. However, despite the good built quality, mine did not last for more than 4 months.\\n\", \"\\n  I have been using these earphones for a week now and use it for 5-6 hours a day.I think that's these are the best earphones in this price range.Here are the Pros and ConsPROS-Amazing Noise cancellation.These are really good for times you don't want be distributed.That being said don't have out of the world expectations.Remember they are wired earphones for the price of just Rs500-Good Bass.The bass is really good and for some songs the earphones legit shake-Good Structure-These earphones are really tough to tangle and it is even tougher to break them.Cons-They don't have the best comfort.I would prefer in-ear earphones BUT when the ear hooks are attached it is much better-Controls- Now not everyone cares but I do.There is only one button from which all the functions have to be done.It would be better if there were say 3 buttonsAll that being said I think that these earphones are a bargain for their price and I really like them.\\n\", '\\n  Excellent earphones for the price. Sturdy and very good build quality. Wire usually does not get tangled, and is easy to remove even if it happens. Ton of earbuds included in the package. Audio quality is pretty good. Vocals are clear, mids and highs are above average and the bass is Superb!!!! Mic quality is also pretty good and no problems there. Some people might find the earphones uncomfortable for long use as the earbuds are large.Although happy with the purchase. Great product for its price.\\n', '\\n  I am surprised, I never expected such bad product from Boat. I bought this product just 2 weeks back and I find quality is really bad.First of all, it slips frequently out of your ear, due to it’s metal body. Secondly, voice is not at all clear, while you talk to someone on phone. Listening music is just ok.I bought it while seeing other customer‘s ratings, they could be right also but I doubt perhaps now boat is compromising with product quality.\\n', '\\n  Alright so I bought these earphones at ₹550 in a deal. Let me divide it into pros and cons for you to decide if the product is right for you.Pros:-1) These earphones emphasizes on “bass” so  bass is good at this price range.2) Earphones are tangle free.3) They come with extra ear buds.4) You won’t need to increase the volume since on my iPhone I have to keep the volume less than 50% and still it sounds decently loud.5) It has an L shaped headphone jack so you it won’t come out easily.Cons:-1) The earpiece are quite heavy I.e they tend to fall out of your ear2) The inlet provided with earphones can cause a bit of pain after removing it. However, you won’t feel it while wearing them.3) The build quality could be better.So, to sum it all up. These bass heads provide a very good bass at this price range and if you are someone who loves bass more than vocals then it’s the right choice for you. I found that the bass is overpowering the mids and highs of music and I needed to adjust the equalizer settings on my phone. I would recommend sennheiser cx180 if you are looking for earphones under ₹1000 but they don’t have a mic so there is a downside to everything.\\n', \"\\n  I bought this earphone and after 6 months one of the earplug is not working so I requested for exchanging a product because it is in warranty , the concerned person came and pick my earphones and placed that for exchanging a product , after 15 days I get notification that your earphone was replaced and it's on the way but after one month I didn't get the earphone , till now I didn't get them. I mailed delivery team , called and tweet about them but no where they do not reply. Do not buy this earphone. Exchange policy is very bad and earphone is also not that good it get worse even after 3 month.\\n\", \"\\n  I ordered this headphones reading the reviews. I received promt delivery however i used this for an hour of opening the box and noticed that the sound of left earbud was slightly lower then the right. I checked the same on sound meter as well and meter showed 4 decibel difference in both headphones. However no review says this problem. Might be this one off case or this lot may have this problem. I returned the product on the same day. Hope Boat will solve this problem. I wasn't expecting much sound quality for this budget but can not stand sound difference in left and right earbud.\\n\", '\\n  Pros - better in price to quality ratio  Nice built quality(strongest headphone ever bought)  Basses are punchy, but not overwhelming  Mids are hearable  Highs are goodTested the frequency response from an app it does have the lowest sensitivity of 18hz (20hz described in specification) which is better.Cons - cousions provided are of cheap plastic and uncomfortable, after using borrowed earbuds from my old sony-ex150 felling better now 😌.\\n', '\\n  I bought this product one year ago... I didnt face any problem till it was under warrenty.. and after 1 yr right side stop working and i was upset about it.. and again after 2 days left side also stopped working... Now its a waste product for me... Firstly the product was good in terms of bass and sound quality but if the earphones is not working the for everyone its a waste.!!!! So buyers be careful while buying... For first few months u wont face any problem but after it u will regrate about it.... And its all upto u ...Thnk u\\n', \"\\n  They are good and as promised the bass is strong but that is it about them. if you are into EDM and Beats then they are perfect for you but if you are into Instrumental or listen to Vocals like me, then I wouldn't really recommended theseAlso I personally enjoy short music session for like 20min and I did find them uncomfortable within that bracket I wouldn't recommended these for prolonged sessionsBut otherwise they are loud enough, no complaints there, I only wished they sounded more clear\\n\", \"\\n  I've used Sennheiser cx 180 and jbl c100si.And i bought this budget friendly now.Pros:-low price-1 year warranty-does not distort at full volume-it will fall from ears (but not if u wear ear wings or hooks)Cons:-at 20-30 volume bass mixes into vocals too much-u must put it at 70 Percent volume for enough performance-bass is coming when not needed-too overrated-build quality seems ok, but packaging box is too small that when u open this headset you will see many bands and curves in wire which are unable to readjust.-because of these curves and band big possibility pf breakage from jack.-it feels cheap, cannot deliver even lil bit surround sound-u will feel exhausted after long time or at high volume.-not so comfortable .Comparison:Cx180 is best for best balanced sound.Jbl c100si is better in bass than cx180, and bass quality is not cheap like boat.Both these are better than boat so far.I suggest Don't buy this boat or any boat headset, better if u want quality sound then buy cx 180 or want balanced bass then jbl c100si.Sennheiser is too comfortable , and durable.Jbl c100si is comfortable also , but not as cx 180. Also with mic headset doesn't last so long compared to without muc headset. So go for without mic handsfree if it's not needed.If your budget is higher buy Sony xb55 which will cost 1500-2000 in offer.\\n\", \"\\n  CHANGE THE NAME! Why are they even named as Bass heads!??I've bought 3 earphones from the boat and I must say Boat is something you should never opt!These earphones barely fit in your ears and keep slipping out because of such a circular body they have with some weight at it ends that makes it slip out again and again!Sound quality?Huh! What's that? That's what these earphones say.Noise cancellation is okayish! Like other earphones a common noise cancellation thing and nothing else.If you are actually looking for sound just go for some another brand and Sony is one I suggest!❤️\\n\", \"\\n  It's 2020 already and I'll suggest you not to buy these headphones (it'll last no more than 1 year)There are better upgraded headphones by boat and this models is pretty old and has long-term quality issues.Nothing to say much about the sound quality ,bass,build quality etc( you can find tons of reviews online)But I can surely tell that the headphones are zero water/sweat resistant .If any how sweat or water enters the mic/switch then say good bye to mic ,it will be damage .Mine got damaged after sweat entered. After some days mic sensitivity will go down and then it will totally stop working and u have to unplug the headphones every time u recieved a call\\n\", '\\n  Writing the review after 4 months, still working as first day, everything is perfect in these headphones, bass is awesome, crystal clear sound, after using these headphones I don’t want to use any other headphones, I really love it, but the wire is bit too long, they said that it’s tangle free but because of its long wire it easily gets tangled, other than that it’s amazing, I dropped it a couple of times but still working just fine, i will definitely recommend these headphones, just go for it, without thinking twice.\\n', \"\\n  PLEASE READ IT TILL THE END FOR A TRUSTWORTHY REVIEW.Starting this review right off with the build quality, it's definitely quite good for the price. The metal casing and tangle free flat wires are something only very expensive earphones have, so a good thumbs up to BoAt for providing this at such an aggressive price.Talking about comfort, i didn't like them much honestly. They were decent at best. Neither uncomfortable nor very comfortable. Just manageable.Coming to the sound quality, now this is the tricky part.Some people will love it, some will hate it.Bass is quite good for the price. They're punchy and if you're an EDM fan or love those thumps in every music, this is the one to go with.The vocals were simply not good. Because of the extra bass, they get muffled up. So while you'll enjoy Badshah ke hiphops, Arijit Singh songs are something you'll not really like on these.Overall ratings:Build 9/10Comfort 8/10Sound:Bass: 9/10Vocals: 6/10Treble 7/10If this review was helpful, please consider marking it helpful. :)\\n\", \"\\n  There is no clarity in sound,only bass is there.It's the worst on high volumes.Build quality is also BAD,mic stopped working after 4 months,it won't last long.These earphones are very uncomfortable,the buds are so hard that you'll feel pain.The buds get detached from the eardrums very easily and it is very annoying. Very annoying while lying on bed,earpieces comes off the ear very easily !!Customer service is the WORST.They don't even bother to replace it.Do not buy these. BOAT used to be good, but now they're selling junk.\\n\", \"\\n  Just amazing, plug them into ears and forget that u r living in a world. I got it for 500rs in deal, so yes more than worth the money. Beautiful sound quality, with each and every minute details be it bass, treble or surrounding quality (3D). Used it for games on mobile, for songs, music and speaches. Unforgettable experience.Pros:- Super built quality.- bought it in 500, so more than worth the money for me.- superb sound quality.- different cushions for ear.- wire don't get tangle everytime, it remains almost straight. Don't have to solve the knots.- irrespective of your device volume level, it'll definitely give you a cut-off from the world around you.Cons:- the metal portion of 3.5mm Jack will be loosen if frequently plugged in and out of slot.- The color of metal ear phone will also start fading if used in rough surfaces.\\n\", '\\n  The Boat Bass head 225 earphone is amazing earphone . It is material quality is one of the best and also sound quality and also durability . Sound quality is one of the best better than senneheizer cx180 . And bass is so good .When you are listen a rock , edm like you can feel bass and vocals songs are so clear . This boat 225 earphone can support Google Assistant really just press 2 second play/pause mic buttons and  open Google Assistant seriously .I purchased on lighting deal 499₹ and cashback 50₹ so price 449₹ . I am so happyBoat Bass bass basssssss basssssss sa\\n', '\\n  My all confusion gone..!What to say about this beast? Was watching YouTube to buy best with Rs.1000.  Saw all so called \"Sold Out\" youtubers are referring their brand. But trust me, this is insane. Highlight is you can feel deeply all of types of music, Bass, Treble, Mid and Vocal. It\\'s standalone Earphone. build quality is just mammoth. I got red colored on for my White colored smartphone which suits very aggressively.It\\'s Cristal clear, No other brands ( Mi, JBL, Realme, Etc under 1000) to compare. You can blindly buy.\\n', \"\\n  Quality is quite good.. Company has majorly focused on the earpiece so you can get little disappointed with the package... But it cope up with polished metal finish and the flat wire which makes it more safer than others..It comes with 5 extra pairs of earbuds sizing S M & L woth colour variation of pure black ones and grey amd orange ones and also a clip to hold wire with your shirt... And that's really impressive..Talking about the sound its almost like the SONY MDRs but om half the price of them.. the 10mm base drive really provides a vibrational bass with ear soothing trebel balance.The earpiece is also comfortable and gets stuck to the ear and the noise cancellation also works well with that...The button placed well with the mic works great with camera, calls, play pause, and changing tracks.The clarity of mic is good and is placed near the mouth.I rated it 4 bcoz it weighs little more than expected.. but if you have used sony mdr then its a sure go..\\n\", '\\n  I am very happy with sound quality but Boat’s Engg. team has made a basic mistake  while designing. Due to metal casing on head of earphones it become too heavy and keep on dropping. I think Boat has also realised the problem with product and to overcome the issue they have provided rubber hooks. But the earphones are not designed to put hooks. From design point of view I give them 0 rating.\\n', '\\n  I am a music lover and tried many headphones like sony, jbl , sennheiser but this boat bass heads over pumps the bass at sometimes which makes us uncomfortable in enjoying music. It is much more louder than other headphones. Build quality is good at this price range.Bass quality and clarity is satisfactory at the price of 500 only.I felt that Vocals and lows are not upto 100% clarity,I recommend this headphone to only those who are bass lovers but not for the ones who loves to enjoy music and lyrics.\\n', \"\\n  To all the prospective buyers, please note this boat headset is a treat to your ears if you are looking for good sound with a great bass. Since I am not a tech geek so cannot give you comparison with other brands and I found this is good enough for my requirement under the limited budget (under 500 bucks). The cable is truly tangle free. However, the one thing that I did not like about this headset is the absence of volume adjustment button or option. This is quite a basic feature yet very important for an old school person like me. I just don't want to depend on my mobile phone for volume up/down thing. Because of that shortcoming I returned the item. I have shared my feedback with the company. I hope they will do something in this concern. Secondly, the play and pause button was not working on my headset. That was another shortcoming in my piece of item. Overall, this is a good headset for those who don't want to spend more than 500 bucks and still want good sound, good bass, sound clarity and don't mind the non availability of volume button.\\n\", '\\n  Buy with no doubts its a best budget earphone as brand name is sufficient to tell about its quality. You can purchase it without hesitation. Though i would like to highlight some cons:A bit noisy means noise cancellation can be improved more.&Packaging should contain an earphone case  which it hasnt.It delivered today so I havent explored it much but if something happens between warranty i will let you know and update my feedback\\n', '\\n  I had purchased these as they had very good reviews and needed these mostly for call and the isolation mic feature was the one that made me purchase these. Sadly after trying them on the metal earbuds seem to be a little heavy and cause a little pain in the ears if use them for long hours and since the primary purpose was for conference calls have decided to return them.\\n', \"\\n  I am writing this review after 2 years of usage, never ever has any headphones lasted for 6 months. But these form boAt have not only lasted, there has not been any deterioration in sound and mic quality.The flat cables ensure no tangling and the steel outer body has ensured this has taken all the beating and getting stamped occasionally.At a frugal budget of 499, I can say nothing comes close to providing your money's worth.\\n\", \"\\n  Originally order it from flipkart for 1 day delivery, but got defrctive product(as usual, y do i even givr thm a chance). Returned, ordered from amazon, working perfectly n delivered in mint condition(as usual from amazon 😂).Sound quality is not that great i would say its a bit better than average tho, i was using sennheiser cx180 before n also jbl cs100.It is the least comfortable of all, but there a lot of accesaries so u can get the earbud of ur choice size n colour too(never seen before).Apart from that the non-tangle tag is nt 100% deserved i would say as without the tag attached, sennheiser headphones never tangle to my surprise. But the flat wires does reduce the amount of tangledness u would expect.Bass is great if u dig that, treble is sub-par.Overall nice product but if you don't need mic n are willing to pay few hunders more i would suggest sennheiser,for its superior sound quality comfortability n durability. (its been a few days with this so i can't say much about durability, but flat wires tend to usually survive longer than normal wired headphones in my experience)\\n\", \"\\n  Good quality cheap earphones.I am writing this review after over 9 months of use and it works like day one, which I appreciate.  Only issue with one of the ear buds that's gone loose and keeps coming out when in the backpack.  Otherwise still good.Likes:- good build quality- decent mix of bass and treble (personal preference). I would say bass is lower than some other headphones out there but better than most in its price range.Dislike:- good overall finish but even after swapping out the ear buds they still seem to fall off my ears with a slight tug\\n\", '\\n  The product produces good bass and enough treble, along with fairly clear sound. There is not much noice and it is loud enough. I have been using JBL 150 SI and I found Boat stands higher in terms of loudness and bass, but lags in treble and overall sound clarity. The item looks great as well. But I decided to return after it was used for few days, as it comes out of ear quite often, owing to the heavy earpiece and cables. Moreover, earpiece is metallic and lengthy , so wearing inside bike helmet or while lying down on one side is painful.\\n', '\\n  Using this from past 4 to 5 months and the headphone has stopped working, not able to hear the voice from other side rather own voice is echoing on both ends. Absolutely not happy with this and there is no option to return this product.Loss of 600 Rs I would say and will not recommend to anyone further.\\n', \"\\n  I bought this assuming the mic wouldn't be important. Unfortunately had to switch with intended user and discovered the mic was awful. It only works when held at a certain direction/distance by hand. Very poor design. The ear-insert is not at an angle - and that makes this significantly worse and not suitable for wearning while running etc.The audio is good though - brighter and more bass than other similar headphones i have used.\\n\", '\\n  Not comfortable even with different ear tips. You will feel it with in 30 minutes of usage.I did not face this issue so far with other brand / model.Though build quality is good, it is not usable. Metal earbuds gets cold, it is an issue and you will know when you start using it.I was looking for a cheaper alternatives for daily webex calls. I should have gone for Sennheiser, Skullcandy, Sony or even JBL.\\n', '\\n  Boat is a very good brand when it comes to mid range audio tech. For the pricing you don’t really have to look elsewhere, I have used Sennheiser premium and skullcandy cheap one’s. I feel boat makes better products comparatively. I recommend going for over the head headphones instead of earphones, for me earphones don’t last long even if I take proper care for them.\\n', \"\\n  Such a wonderful product it is if you know how to use it in the right way. You have to optimize the bass on the software level of your phone. Or by installing bass boosters from play store. Speaker quality is just awesome. Has deep bass with highest quality. If you have realme phones, by at your own risk. In my case, Realme didn't allow me to boost bass. Maybe something would have been changed in newer phones of Realme but buy at your own risk. Works perfectly with MI phones. I have tested it on 6 MI devices and the output after boosting bass is pixel perfect. It also works well, but not as much as on MI in Vivo mobiles.Verdict: Such a good earphone it is. If you don't get enough bass, something is wrong on your phone or on it's hardware which you might want to optimize manually.\\n\", \"\\n  First of all, I would like to clear I use a hell lot of earphones and headphones. I purchased this product to check if it justifies its so called FEATURES or not.I have been using these earphones for 2 MONTHS now.BUILD QUALITY-I won't say the BUILD QUALITY is Amazingly good, but yeah it isn't bad at all, in two months i haven't felt that these will get broken or something like that.BASS QUALITY-Now coming to that OVER ADVERTISED BASS QUALITY it isn't that great at all, I am a bass lover, these provide a good amount of bass for the price point but not one of the best in the market. It can make you have a terrific headache.SOUND QUALITY-Now the SOUND QUALITY, it's surprisingly good and not bad at all, for the price they are the best sounding earphones available but their HIGHS & LOWS are terrible. You won't hear these clearly, but MIDS are good for the price.LOOK AND COMFORT -Now coming to LOOK and COMFORT, despite of the METAL DESIGN these don't look premium at all. They look like some cheap earphones of the local market and they are not comfortable at all in the ear. The given ear buds and ear hooks lasts for a short time, the ear hooks don't help the pair to stick to the ear at all.CONCLUSION- These earphones are not the best in the market but surely ONE OF THE BEST available for the price point. I hope.you like the review.\\n\", \"\\n  Be careful with mic i have replaced this because while working out the mic got damaged and it took more than 6 months to get them back from boat as i claimed warranty.At first they are very active during the process the earphones are claimed on Warranty but after few days they lost the product and didn't even inform and when I contacted customer care then they reinitiated the process,so to avoid all the mess take care of ur mic it gets easily damaged with water.But except mic overall performance is awesome 👌\\n\", \"\\n  Its a nice earphone for around 500 rs but there are better options out there. BOAT earphones are nice but IMO not as nice as Sony,JBL,Samsung,Senheiser etc. These are above average in sound quality, durable and fit into your ear well. Mic also works fine and had no issues taking calls with these. I found the wire to be too long though.Overall, its a decent option but don't expect JBL level sound.\\n\", \"\\n  Bought this earphones on May of 2020 , taught to let's give it a try for the boat earphones.Tested and used for 5 months and reviewing this on October 2020 after proper observation and testing.First.. most people want price to performance which I would give a rating of 4.8/5. The sound is clear and bass is also great at the price point of 400rs . The colour I purchased is radium green which looks more crazy and stylish.If we compare to other brands like JBL or sony this is slightly less in terms of performance than others brands buy anyway the earphones are 100%, great as for me I have not faced any issues still now and am giving the review so that orther can take my opinion for there best to purchase.Box : nice package you get 6 different ear tips and a ear type of hooks(4/5)Quality:::Sound - truly clear and lound  rating(5/5)Noise cancellation: okay but not great as expected for the price.... (this has a passive noise cancellation which means when you plug the earphones the surrounding sound may be decreased to 30-40% even when the music is not playing)Bass: is also okay for the price and please don't expect more for the rang...... Rating  (3.8/5)The seller is also  authorised  and got it on time delivery.Should I recommend you yes obviously it's great for price and most importantly it's made in india.Jai hind! Stay safe!Thanks\\n\", \"\\n  I don't why this much hype for this earphone? This is a very uncomfortable earphones.I have used too many earphones 🎧 but it is in all of them except the 60 rs earphones.IT DON'T FIT PROPERLY IN YOUR EARS AND OFTEN FALLS OFF FROM THE EARS AND ALSO ITS SIDE TEXTURE CUTTING HURTS THE EARS.The sound is also distorted, too much bass which ruins the treble it seems like you are playing only instrumentals.BUT LOOKS AND DESIGN IS VERY COOL.\\n\"], 'url': 'https://www.amazon.in/BassHeads-225-Super-Extra-Headphones/dp/B01M9C51T9/ref=sr_1_22?dchild=1&fst=as%3Aoff&pf_rd_i=6308595031&pf_rd_m=A1K21FY43GMZF8&pf_rd_p=2c2b4d9e-f15e-4cf3-8e5c-acf68c668c41&pf_rd_r=80WR7NYVY11014AWK7F7&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_t=101&qid=1601263641&refinements=p_85%3A10440599031&rnid=10440598031&rps=1&s=electronics&sr=1-22', 'category': 'Mobile', 'destination_urls': ['/Clavier-Carrying-Portable-Protection-Headphone/dp/B07T6F17YX/ref=bmx_1/261-0582527-7835017?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07T6F17YX&pd_rd_r=4c2b142a-f436-4b44-a437-2b1f6dd72f5b&pd_rd_w=Vagdc&pd_rd_wg=cfXQv&pf_rd_p=08abe11d-4ee5-46ca-8471-7bf18c53fc91&pf_rd_r=NVM6E4TD5QQGCM54600S&psc=1&refRID=NVM6E4TD5QQGCM54600S', '/Boat-Bassheads-242-Earphones-Resistance/dp/B07S9S86BF/ref=pd_sbs_23_1/261-0582527-7835017?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07S9S86BF&pd_rd_r=4c2b142a-f436-4b44-a437-2b1f6dd72f5b&pd_rd_w=apaIS&pd_rd_wg=cfXQv&pf_rd_p=00b53f5d-d1f8-4708-89df-2987ccce05ce&pf_rd_r=NVM6E4TD5QQGCM54600S&psc=1&refRID=NVM6E4TD5QQGCM54600S', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A02068671LGEJMTQ1FXGC&qualifier=1602310818&id=2392177244297243&widgetName=sp_detail&url=%2Fdp%2FB08HCPMHJZ%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB08HCPMHJZ%26pd_rd_w%3DwnHMG%26pf_rd_p%3D1801b34c-8af9-42b5-8961-11f124edc99b%26pd_rd_wg%3DcfXQv%26pf_rd_r%3DNVM6E4TD5QQGCM54600S%26pd_rd_r%3D4c2b142a-f436-4b44-a437-2b1f6dd72f5b', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A0808323GSHVCG18IXB1&qualifier=1602310817&id=2336699637249801&widgetName=sp_detail2&url=%2Fdp%2FB07GVYG2L3%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1']}, {'_id': {'$oid': '5f815873aaa28c53dfe2b47e'}, 'description': 'OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)', 'price': '₹27,999', 'rating': '4.1 out of 5 stars', 'review_count': '16,364', 'reviews': [\"\\n  Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.\\n\", \"\\n  It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review.\\n\", '\\n  Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....\\n', \"\\n  Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:• Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.•Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.•60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅•Premium user-experience.•face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.•Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.•The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here✌️*UPDATED*•Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)•Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.•No serious heating issues at all.•This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.•One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)\\n\", '\\n  Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don’t panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!But don’t  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved.\\n', \"\\n  Got it delivered yesterday , used for about 5-6 hours , to tell you this is my first mid ranger previously I was using s9 plus , before that s7 edge and iphones in stone age .My first one plus , a mid ranger , I assure you it's no less a flagship experience , forget bout negative reviews, no device is perfect .This one has looks , power and performance , don't know how useful is 5G modem but who cares that's the baggage we consider it as of nowCamera unit is also awesome perfoms well and remember it's a bloat free and advt free experience of OXYGEN OS .Cons , I am yet to discoverENJOY the NORD\\n\", '\\n  I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption \"World First AR launching\". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.AR is must and should technology in 2020phones. Even 10K phones are giving better support.Why One plus released a skull without brain. So I return this worthless (for me). Waste of time.\\n', \"\\n  An amazing phone!Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected.Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better.The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone.Camera could've been a little better.The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones.Fast as hell.Colors are very vibrant.Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.Will update on display issues (claims by many) after a month's time.\\n\", '\\n  Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average. 1 rating giving only for this. Otherwise features are good.\\n', '\\n  ProSmooth OS - no lags at allAMOLED screen is good quality screenPrivacy - no useless apps like those found in chinese phonesAll other pros we would expect for these specs - no deviationsConNot a metal frameCPU is slower compared to current 865 flagships (this is expecetd)Note: I am releived the display is fine at low brightness - I read  some users sharing the green tint issue.  I did not face that yet.  Will update reviews in case of any issues.\\n', \"\\n  Brilliant..I have uploaded some pics of selfie as well as Portrait shot of near by shot.What is loved is phone has very good sensor.It's my first phone after my job so it's really special for me.Fine Screen..Smooth touch..Camera is beast. Selfie is beast. Screen fingerprint is smooth. Can't fine a better phone. 256gb is never ending storage.Cons:Some apps lags like gaana FacebookTouch of 90hzs is not up to what other OnePlus device have.Phone heats up while gaming for more than 20 minutes.Portrait shot blurs some area.Google lens must take pictures, macro camera is uselessNew Hydrogen update is no where to be foundI took pics with my mom dad they loved it.\\n\", '\\n  I used several phone except like this type of phone but this phone is very silky smoothy.90hz refresh rate speed is very good or smooth like an iPhone 11.the keypad touch was also very smooth.audio is mono speaker only but it is also good audiable(something missing in the speaker).the camera is fair.i think next update this camera quality also increase.this phone very very user-friendly .wrap charging is 30 minute time take 0 to 65% charge completed that was very excited.the  I appreciated OnePlus company because of less price for nord.\\n', '\\n  Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.\\n', '\\n  Average phone from one plus but surprisingly very bad battery life though good battery on paper. Disappointed .\\n', \"\\n  \\xa0Stop cheating customers by arranging a tempered delivery with only an empty mobile box. It's my hard earned money and the Amazon investigation team is refuting all claims.I have enough evidences to prove my claim of tempered delivery and will escalate the matter to the highest level and will also drag Amazon India on all social media besides suing them.in Consumer court.\\n\", \"\\n  I have nothing to say about this product but marketing strategy. While pre-ordering this product there was no hdfc bank creditcard offer so I have to purchase it by paying full amount. But after delivery it is showing hdfc credit card discount is applicable for 12gb + 256gb variant. This is ridiculous. There's not even return option for this product. This is not at all fair to the customer who pre-ordered this product. And OnePlus and Amazon is just breaking their trust.\\n\", \"\\n  OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment.Pros.Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ...1. screen looks great2. Camera works descently but after some struggle3. Warp charge4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking5.screen brightnessCons.1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience.2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate.3. Mono speakerIt's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass.4.ufs 2.1The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it..I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool.If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again.This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance..OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment.It's just a midranger phone in the end.For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlusHope this helps ...thanks\\n\", \"\\n  don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. i have vivo z1 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and vivo is only for 18k. one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product.\\n\", \"\\n  It's very poor phone company lair battery charger 30min 70% but it's not true\\n\", \"\\n  I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6.But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation.I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days.\\n\", \"\\n  Amazing design. Amazing feel. Pretty smooth. Best in its range. However, came across a bug on the first day of usage. Can't link device to redclub membership. This has been reported by multiple people on community and looks like the developers are looking into it. Apart from that the first day use has been really great. The battery is amazing. Using it since 12 hours and 40% still left.Update- The bug was fixed on the same day.\\n\", \"\\n  Being OnePlus user from start.. Expected lot from this mobile.. Nord in hand doesn't give that premium experience that u get from rest OnePlus mobiles...Build is very cheap...This mobile is like oppo, vivo...Should hav gone for OnePlus 8... Extremely dissatisfied\\n\", \"\\n  Delivery was fast, delivered on the mentioned date. Box packing was beaten. Unlike onplus box, all the edges were bent as if the box was fallen multiple times.As per product, phone look good, for sure this doesn't look like a premium phone, unlike other oneplus phones. Box quality and finishing itself say this is a cheaper oneplus so don't expect premium experience.Another disappointment from oneplus, the redcableclub doesn't work for Nord, on the redcableclub Nord model is not listed, evening phone setup when to try to link the device it fails stating this device is already linked to another account. Yet to explore the phone features and its performance. Will share it once is use it for couple of days.---------++++------After a month usage, I can rate this as most disappointing phone OnePlus has created. After few minutes in hand I can literally feel the pain due to its deisgn and weight. Biggest disappointment is the camera, out of 5 shots 3 will be blurry pixelated. Even after they pushed an update for camera still take couple of shots before you get one clear blurr free picture. You can only take still photos even a slightest movement either the phone or the person moves picture turns blurr. Phones of low resolution and less expensive take better picture then Nord.Definitely a big no to this phone. whish I could exchange it with some other phone. Maybe realme/ redmi\\n\", \"\\n  First look is cool.But too much weight.Not easy in use.When you open some web page or other app ,you want to go back there is not easy option to go back.12gb ram is wasted because it's working like 6gb ram mobile.My heart saying that I return this product.\\n\", \"\\n  Dear camera enthusiasts,Don't go for OnePlus NORD. It is pretty much the opposite of the flagship camera that they had promised.1. Poor low light performance especially for front camera2. Lacks in sharp and crisp outputBetter go for OnePlus 7T\\n\", '\\n  Where is call recording option\\n', '\\n  Phone 5/5Phone is fantastic, everything as expected.But the box was open. No seal on box. Though items are fine inside but might be duplicate as well. This is not a good exp for a prebooked phone.Box1/5\\n', \"\\n  So I pre ordered this phone on 28th of July and I got this on 3rd August.... Thank you Amazon for faster delivery ...I'm posting this review after using this phone after a bit ..I'm sub dividing this review in pros and cons .Pros-1. The design of the phone and overall build looks premium it is moulded in a way that it doesn't feel cheap aur even midrange by any means. If you want a quirky look then go for the blue marble .but trust me the gray version looks very elegent.2. The fluidity and smoothness of the oxygen can't go wrong in anyway. That bundled with Snapdragon 765g is even more good.3. The display on this device looks dope . Fluid amoled panel along with 90hz display just looks awesome. And trust you won't be able to tell the difference between 90hz refresh rate of this phone and the 120hz refresh rate of anyother ohone.4.Battery backup of this phone is also awesome you'll get a whole lot of day backup even if you're using the phone intensively at 90hz refresh rate.5. The cameras for this price range won't disappoint you , you'll get detailed photos with the primary lens ..you'll get super cool ultrawide shots with the other lens .. let's wait for the cons part for other two cameras. The dual front selfi cameras does their job very effectively be it selfie aur groufie.6. As a cherry on the top OnePlus have promised 2 years of android update and 3 years Of security patch for this phone .7. This phone is future proof as you're getting 5g ready phone for this price.Cons.1. Don't buy this phone for only intensive gaming purpose as this have a 765g processor which will fall behind a bit behind 855 or 865.2. The cameras are good but not the best , the macro lens and depth sensors on the back are just useless in my Frank opinion.3. The frame of the phone is plastic , but trust me you won't notice this.Personal Opinion.Go for this phone you'll surely love it , according to me you should go for the 12gb ram and 256rom variant.If you find this review helpful please consider to like this review\\n\", '\\n  Received A Faulty Device As First Only And Received The phone Where Speaker Was Not Working...\\n', '\\n  I was opted for exchange with my RedMi note 7 pro to purchase OnePlus nord 8GB modal.I am impressed with OxygenOS, Bloatware free and Camera (especially main camera video and slow motion videos are superb)Pro’s:• OxygenOS – gives very good user experience than other android mobiles.• 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display• Camera’s – image processing is very good in this mobile while using back main camera, nightscape, slow motion video and front camera• Stable video recording – with Optical and electronic image stabilization• Supports 5G network – I am not sure when it is going to be launched in India (may be in 2021.?)• Snapdragon 765G 5G chipset – supports 5G network with midrange performance (excellent for daily usage)Cons:• Camera’s for depth and macro photos – especially 2 mp macro lens giving poor quality output• Not suggestable for users who prefer heavy gaming like PUBGI don’t find more cons as of nowColor tint issue?Not found in my mobile, while screen light dims less than 20%.If your priority is not gaming, this could be considerable option.\\n', '\\n  Really very disappointed with the performance, as battery is not so good, charging time is too late as given by the company, device display quality is also not good\\n', '\\n  First of all I wanna thank amazon delivery service to deliver the product on right time as I want to gift it to my sister.Oneplus is a no match in this range.  You should go for this without any doubt.Except poor camera quality eveything is superb. Snapdragon 765G is fast and 90Hz display is superb. I am not getting screen tilting problem in low light as some users reported.One more low point is that it does not feel  premium as its side is made of plastic.Go for it without any second thought.I will edit my review after some days of use.\\n', \"\\n  Hey Guys i won't go in Specs details as you are not reading this to read the specs. I got it on 2nd August and after more than 24 hours of use i can say my decision and wait was all worth it.Phone is great. One plus is indeed flagship killer, its manufared by oppo india, and i have serious piece of advice for people who are considering buyingOppo Reno 4Dont waste your money there instead get nord, i have seen for years how oppo charges atleast 10K premium for devices that have even year old processors. You can get SD765 instead of SD720 and even nord's top varient costs 5k less than 'Reno Shit'.And those considering Realme X3 pro zoom there's nothing special about it except for the fact that you wanna buy go with SD855 only you can seriously consider buying Nord coz apart for SD855 nord is better in every department and you don't realise any difference whether its day today tasks or heavy gaming.\\n\", '\\n  In love with the camera quality and the color of the phone. Works smoothly. Impressed!!Also online sale is on 4th and I got it today (on 2nd). Swift delivery.\\n', '\\n  Camera:selfi camera is great. back camera is medium quality not great like 8 pro. I tried gcam in this mobile, image quality increases.Performance:Blazing fast like SD 865. There is no difference noted in using daily usage. You only Notice difference in heavy gaming and heavy tasks from 765g and 865 processors.Speaker:Its is loud enough and does its job for its price for 28000 of phone. Dont expect like flagship speakers. if u put volume below 50%, volume of speaker is low and increase the volume above 50%, then speaker volume increases suddenly. At 100% volume, sound comes with some noise.Battery:i got SOT of 6 hrs with 90hz. battery losts easily for one day. When using camera battery drain faster.Display:great display like 7t. blacks are deep. No tint issues in display. colours are accurate. viewing angles are great. All google apps in dark mode are in grey colour(this is not a tint issue). So dont decide tint issue with google apps. Use dark wallpaper and then decide ur tint issueVerdict:If you are a Heavy Gamer(Only with ultra high gaming settings is not suitable but suites for lite gamers) and Camera centric user this mobile is not for u. Apart from camera and speaker, it is great phone. Mainly VALUE FOR MONEY.\\n', \"\\n  I always want a oneplus mobile now I have one it's a good mobile\\n\", '\\n  Waste of money , Not at all satisfied ,poor camera quality , poor product quality. Better to buy Redmi mobile ...\\n', \"\\n  First things first I'm very impressed by the AMAZON delivery services.Coming to NORD It got all the hype. Easily recommendable if you use it as a regular phone for social media and business purpose. It is not so great for gamers. So think before you buy it and compare all the other options too.Last things last overall performance is very fast and enjoying the OXYGEN OS.\\n\", '\\n  It was a big jump for me from budget phone to One plus Nord! I was skeptical before buying such high price phone and that too without any discount (I bought during Amzon pre-order period, as it has to be gifted to my wife, 8/128 INR 27999/-).  But after I open the pack I felt relived. Build quality is superb and feels solid. Photo quality is plus plus...I took some photos in dark and they were crisp and clear. Colours of photos looks natural and attractive!I never looked so handsome before :-) I need more time to explore all pro features.Overall all are plus plus as of now! My wife loved the phone and thats the biggest plus :-)\\n', \"\\n  It's delivered today (3rd August)Branding level improved.Some sticker in box.Mobile is lite weight.Color is extremely premium.Screen quality same as 7T.Let's wait for detail feedback hope it will good 👻💕\\n\", \"\\n  Expected a lot, now struggling to justify myself..!! Obliviously pre-ordered  and got it on 4th Aug. Keeping all the hypes aside, its a decent phone with all the latest features and an average performance in most of the areas. Camera doesn't sound to be bad as like most of us heard on the initial reviews. Its in fact truly awesome, but few distortions in low light and indoor clicks. Also no tint issue so far for me which has been widely reported. We will definitely going to miss the Ear phone jack and memory card slot in this new Oneplus Nord. Obviously its a genuine 5G phone though India yet to upgraded to that level.As per me, below are key challenges which i am experiencing currently with this Nord.  1) Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate  2) Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength  3) Nord is not a good option for gamer's  4) Battery performance is absolutely average, but 30 W Warp Charge power adapter is a blessingHope Oneplus will soon come up with some software upgrades and reduce the impact due to the above challenges for their users.If you are not looking for a high performing flagship mobile, Nord could be a King and satisfies you in all the aspects. Still its a Mid-rage King..!!\\n\", \"\\n  Very bad experience don't buy this product, the mobile display lighting very dull compare with redmi Mobile's and mobile over heating and camera quality very worst, don't buy this product. If you want this mobile please reach out nearby oneplus showroom and use this mobile and if you satisfied then you buy this product. I'm very unsatisfied this product 😔😔😔😔😔\\n\", \"\\n  One of the worst front cameras in recent days. Apart from that, it's a deal at this price.\\n\", '\\n  Just received OnePlus Nord grey 256 gb variant and trust me guys it is just amazing,worth every rupees.\\n', \"\\n  Had lots of expectations on this device but it destroyed in an hour.1.Camera is literally bad, I mean really really bad (still I had considered this because of oxygen OS)2.Display tent issue, if you turn down the brightness below 40%)3. Fast charging doesn't at all support ( see the picture of my phone) takes more than 2 hour approximately to get full charge)4. Speaker sound is not good I would say okay.Extremely disappointed had to return this.\\n\", '\\n  Phone is not good. I give review correct but amazon not ready to display on web side because amazon need to sell more phone\\n', \"\\n  So I suppose I'm the first one to receive this beast from Amazon. Arrived damn early then expected!!!!Talking about phone-Display- 90hz fluid amoled display is amazing. Just can't resist to use for a longer time. 5/5Processor- Since there was lot of hype for this new SD765G which supports 5G. I'll put it this way that it supports intensive gaming as well. Played pubg and there is no lag at all and opens game in a flash. There is gaming mode for gamers. Handles everything very smoothly. 5/5Camera- Haven't tested a lot yet. Though main camera is good. Same as OP8. But other camera are not that great as one might think. They work good though and at this price you can't argue for more. It has wide angle and that is good as well. Nightmode haven't used till now. Will post that as well once I'll test that. 4/5Battery- Till now it's awesome. 4115mAh battery is sufficient for a day's work. If we include gaming you might want to charge twice a day. But again that's ok. So bang on! 5/5Charging- 30T wrap charging.. it quite fast!! 5/5UI- Who wants anything else if you get oxygen OS. Best in class and superior factor to consider OP phones. It classy. No BS at all. Authentic OP design.  5/5Design and build- Nice build, fits perfectly in hand. Gorilla glass in front and back just plastic in side and that's not an issue in anyway!! 5/5Overall it's a powerful package from OP.. I would say worth the hype!!!!Go for any color you like.. I preferred grey onyx.Box included OnePlus nord, RCC card, high quality transparent case. Case is literally very good. I just want one more case in case I need in future :p 2 yrs of confirmed OS upadte. And moreover there was already an OTA update when you switch on the device for camera and other bug fixes.Amazing work by OP!! Just awaiting for pre-order gift vouchers now!!\\n\", \"\\n  I don't like this phoneCompany says no replacement or no cancellationThis is cheating\\n\", '\\n  1 star for the display. Green and purple tint clearly visible in daylight without even going into dark room and reducing brightness. Even the black bar is clearly visible in dark theme. My iphone 6 and oneplus 3 have a better panel than this.And 0 stars to Amazon and the seller Darshita electronics for the delay in order. Preordered on 28th and received on 8th. Whereas people who ordered on prime day sale got the phone quicker.Will never pre-order again and definitely not from Amazon.\\n', \"\\n  Firstly a lot of reviews are towards the camera..... of course it's not flagship, for the price you're paying it's well worth it for a balanced experience......you can't expect it to be flagship in all levels.....if you want then buy a specific phone catered to that like rog for gaming.etc-Smooth fluidic screen movements-Fast performance 12gb ram-Decent camera with 4k feature-Speaker volume is loud and sound is clear\\n\", '\\n  Phone received today. Bought it for my mother. She seems to like it a lot. Software experience as expected is very smooth. No lags faced. Would have loved a headphone jack instead of some of the camera (only the primary rear camera is good) . Accessories are all good. Tried out the cameras with gcam mod and the results are comparable to a pixel phone (well oneplus gave decent primary front and rear camera hardware but software is bad). The battery life is good (2 hrs of video and browsing and loss of ~11% battery) so expect it to last all day for sure.\\n', '\\n  Not value for money, you are spending 30K for one plus phone but they not providing same to u. For same feature you will get in 22K phone. Only plus point is in one plus is this is 5G ready and 12Gb 256 storage phone.I have shared some pictures of Oneplus and same i have click from 18K phone Real me 6 pro. And i feel Real Realme bttr phone compair to Oneplus.\\n', '\\n  This is one plus quality.... ....Recived in this condition..... 😔\\n', '\\n  A bad phone Asked to return Refused to return No such phone is mentioned feeling bad\\n', '\\n  Pre-booked on July and got delivered in Aug4. After a day use, felt that 90Hz is added factor those who are watching 1080p movie and high-end gaming. First time charging took lot of time and second time 10mins, 80% charged from 25%.1. Primary reason for purchasing NORD is for camera spec and advertised as \"Copied from Onplus8\",but failed to impress.  I think camera is borrowed from Budget phone, \"DEFINITELY NOT FROM ONEPLUS 8\".Quality is same as Expected sharpness in image. Image is blurred while zooming. Image quality is at par with Redmi Note3.2.Sound Quality is borrowed from cheap china mobile. Not expected from ONEPLUS.3. Felt battery getting drained too fast for normal usage.Hope ONEPLUS is listening all NORD users concern and it will be addressed in OXYGEN OS11.\\n', '\\n  Perfect mobile everyonein this mobile very good pics very clear very light weight smoothy touch sound very good in mobile12gb ram and 256gb what a speed I love this mobile very muchIn this budget great mobile nord seriesSuperb performance\\n', \"\\n  Writing the review after a month's usage and phone works really fine and no lag at allPros- display is really awesome with 90hz smooth and fast refresh rateOxygen OS experience is awesomeFast charging i.e charges upto 70% in 35 minsVideo quality is great due to OISCamera quality has improved than the beginning due to the time to time updates by OnePlusFingerprint reader and face unlock works fastMobile network and calling is really good in low network areasCons- No headphone jackBattery drains really fast when used continuously for long timeFront camera doesn't seem to be 32mp and could be better with software updates\\n\", '\\n  First let me clarify this: \"Nord does not have any disturbing tinge issues as hyped by the media\" A very slight purple color appears when you use it in dark with lowest brightness and that too looks good instead of disturbing. And I am pretty certain that I will not be using that setting ever!Overall the product is really good. The build of the phone is very premium. Main camera, selfie cameras are very good. Macro is a waste, though. You can take better macro shots from the main camera itself. I am not too fond of photography so I don\\'t bother with it\\'s presence/absence.Oxyzen OS as always is ❤️. 90hz display, battery, warp charge makes it a very good product.Will recommend to buy this phone. Missing headphone jack might bother you if you are not using blutooth earphones but I am okay with it.Overall impression: Good phone if you get it for 25k (8GB ram variant)\\n', \"\\n  My Nord was delivered on 2nd August. After a week, these are my reviews.Pros1)  Fluid AMOLED Display and 90 Hz display rate gives the display exactly what your eyes need for a soothing experience (did not experience the tint issue yet).2)  After using Redmi Note 5 Pro for more than 2 years (the advertisements are hell), the Oxygen OS feels heavenly.3)  I bought the Gray Onyx version. It looks really premium.4)  The mobile is really fast and smooth.5)  You will be genuinely impressed with the face unlock speed with this mobile. The fingerprint scanner was also fairly fast (I really liked the various ways you could customize fingerprint unlock animations; the cosmos one is pure love).6)  My mom has Oppo A5 2020, and this mobile is smaller than that one. This set feels surprisingly handy (which really goes with the lightweight build of this mobile).7)  This is my first OnePlus, so the charging cable and the adapter really impressed me. (Charging speed results done by me when the mobile was switched off and was at 0% : 50% at 24 minutes, 61% at 30 minutes (9% short of their claim), 80% at 41 minutes, 100% at 58 minutes).8)  Again, my first OP, so the Alert slider impressed me as well.9)  Not a pro gamer, but this mobile has a FNATIC mode for games. Yet to test what it actually does, but my gaming experience was fairly good.10)  The zen mode. I liked this touch a lot. Reminds us that there is a life outside of your mobile too (go talk with your family and have a nice chat with them).11)  The reading mode. Again, another thing I liked (pardon me if these are common features in mobiles of this range). I read a lot, and I don't like ebooks much. But even when you are scrolling down Google learning about the life cycle or genetic composition of the Coronavirus, the black and white mode feels soothing to the eye.Neutral1)  For camera, which I know is a prime requirement for many, please look into other reviews. I am not a voracious camera user, so my views on this would be unfair to you readers. The only review I can give is that, in low light, while taking a photo, if your hand shakes, the picture comes a little hazy.Cons1)  Battery. Yes. Many people in the OnePlus community have raised this issue as well. I will just write down my issues. If you use the mobile normally, the mobile should go on for a day (that is, you will have to charge it once a day). Even if you play games, the battery tries to handle itself, and I would call that performance average.However, if you switch on Hotspot, battery drains like a flowing river downhill a mountain. I have some tasks that I do in the laptop, and I do not have a ethernet connection, so this is an issue for me. Kindly keep this in mind.2)  You knew this was coming. The 3.5 mm jack that everyone loves.3)  Although the speaker is loud, stereo speakers would have been better.4)  Not an issue for me, but yes, you can get better processors at this price (Realme X2 pro, for example).5)  Again, not an issue for me, but no SD card support. (The lack of SD card support and 3.5 mm jack is becoming prevalent, it seems).6)  I wish the frame wasn't of plastic, but it is (Although the buttons are of metal).ConclusionI can not emphasize much how much I am liking this mobile. If you like watching anime, movies, or even youtube, the screen will feel like a bliss.Among the 6 cons I have written, I can still live with 5 of them, but the battery draining issue is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. My Redmi Note 5 Pro handled being a Hotspot better than this mobile. I don't know if it is possible to fix this by an OTA update.I sincerely request all users of OP Nord to check their battery backup. You can comment below if you want to.Note: All of these are personal reviews. Thank you for reading quite a long review. You won't regret buying this, that is for sure.\\n\", \"\\n  Worst experience from OnePlus ..Phone display having serious Black bar and green tint issue which a cannot be ignored..I was a OnePlus 6T user and there is no issue with the device till now..

Very very  poor from amazon.\\n', '\\n  My Nord Journey with Amazon:-15 Jul - Pre Ordered Nord with ₹499.18 Jul - Recd Pre ordered kit (1st Git Box) include with a T Shirt, AR Invite and Stickers.28 Jul - Prebook Nord (Gray Onyx 12 +256) with ₹29999.05 Aug - Received Nord before Open sell start.Now - Waiting for the Mail containing the 2nd Gift Voucher code from Amazon.** Received new update Oxygen OS 10.5.3 immediately after switched on the Phone.Now i shared a quick Review of my Nord after 6 hrs of heavy use.Pros :✓ Oxygen OS with latest Android 10.✓ Built Quality is good with gorilla glass 5 protection on both front and back.(U r not Jerry that u rig everything so dont panic about built quality).✓Brighter display with 90Hrs refresh rate.✓ Quad Camera setup with a good day light Photography.✓ Duel selfie camera.✓ Light weight and easy to grip.✓ 2 yrs of Regular software updates and 3 yrs of security updates.✓ Battery backup is quite good.✓5G Processor. 765G is the winner in his segment.✓ Both Sim working fine.✓ Sound quality is very nice working gine with Bullet Wireless Z. No connectivity issue.✓ No heating issue noticed during use.✓ 30 W Warp charger. Charging speed similar to OP 8 Pro.✓ Fingerprint scanner is very fast.Cons :✓ Minor Display issue. A negotiable bar is visible towards front camera on extreme low light conditions or zero brightness condition.(Not lucky 2nd time. After received a perfect OP 8 Pro with no display issue). Hope it will solve by software update as OnePlus already mentioned it in their community page.✓ Need improvement in low light photography on front camera.✓ All 4 side pannel were made by plastice meterial, so there will be a chance of some scratches in future if u use a case on it. Noticed some lines on the top side of the phone after applying creator case.✓No Dolby Atmos.✓No 3.5 mm jack.## One updated feature in Oneplus Launcher setting i noticed in Nord, that is still missing on my OP 8 Pro...\\n', \"\\n  Just got the mobile..1st impression - minimal design, no useless app, got the os update... But ! The camera ! Not statisfied.. currently I'm using Poco F1.. even though the Nord has quad rear cam with latest sensor, but the images are too grainy.. my Poco F1 produces much more better image..This is within 2hours review after having the product.. I'll update further after using it sometimes..\\n\", '\\n  Nice phone but the green tint issue is very noticeable on 50 percente brightness and is annoying the why 2 stars. Rest of good. Also photos in artificial light give a very pale colour to skin\\n', '\\n  While charging, Video calling , simple Net browsing (separately)There is no Return/Replace policy for defective products as inspection guy says Amazon will fetch money from his pocket if he allows replacement and amazon is not satisfied with the issue...So indirectly no one will take risk to approve these internal issue as they are afraid what if amazon doesnt get satisfied .. like how i was not able to satisfy the inspection guy.. its all about inspection guys wish .. if he wants then only your issue will get resolved ..else you have to live with the defective product.\\n', '\\n  Dont fall for oneplus marketing and hype..I recieved a damaged oneplus nord as i unboxed.. back cover was seperated from the frame and there was a black patch on it.. the phone too never switched on..The irony is, oneplus claims on their website\"Droped. Shocked. Shook. Sunburned.\" \"We take quality seriously\" but their phone was ripped apart inside the box itself. A dead phone in the end. They fooled us! Infact if u research nord also is facing display and bluetooth issues besides inferior construction which i got to know after i had already made a purchase. Guys i am no one to say dont buy oneplus.. u have to be wise enough to take that call.. but all i can say that dont fall into their trap of marketing and hype they create. Be wise and dont be fooled!\\n', '\\n  Display tint issue in my modelAmazon refused to replace my phone.\\n', '\\n  Pros1.Software experience is awesome.Cons1.poor camere performance.2.battery drains quickly3.lagging found while using some apps swipe.\\n', \"\\n  Well let's talk about the Features and performance of the phone first of all I Pre ordered this phone and it is my first OnePlus device I am using it and the best thing I like in this phone is that the OxygenOs which is buttery smooth and no lag and I was testing this device since 1 week and the over-all performance of this phone is very good only processor is a bit less like we should expect a flagship processor like Snapdragon 855 but in terms of pricing they choose 765g with 5g ready for future proof , let's talk about the camera quality well I was testing the camera and it is lit trust me the colors and pixels are bright and good like daylight pictures are just fabulous! For the gaming I don't find any lag issues or heating issues And the 1080p recording is just smooth and stable I have tested the stability of the video and it is superb. Let's talk about the display now - this amoled display is awesome and 90hz screen refresh rate makes everything buttery in terms of scrolling up and down! And the haptic feedback is also great while typing.. let's talk about some Cons- Could have go for Snapdragon 855 , Plastic frame doesn't make this phone premium , no headphone jack.Overall I would rate this phone 9.5 out of 10. :)\\n\", '\\n  Almost everything you get under 30k price range... Oxygen OS is the best android skin right now... Experiencing it under 30k is a deal breaker...There are other smartphones with Snapdragon 800 series processors under 30k.. but not all of them are bloatware free except OnePlus...Buy this phone if you love to have a nice UI, great display, good camerasAbsolutely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a phone under 30kProvding a headphone jack to type-c  would have been very good\\n', \"\\n  After reading other reviews, I think most of the people here were looking for a flagship phone for a 28-30k price tag. For me, I've been upgrading my phone almost every couple of years and that too from flagship to flagship. I got Nord after 6T and there's a huge difference in both phones, I'll mention my pros and cons :-Pros-•OnePlus is a company that listens to it's customers, there were minor bugs in the software which were fixed in an update I got after using the phone for a week.•The Oxygen OS feels fast (compared to 6T) paired with 90hz display and Snd765G, people there are 4 memory channel instead of 2 which is usually the case in Snd845 and travelling speed varies due to that.•The phone looks and feel premium as promised, you wouldn't even feel the plastic body and unless you're super strong or a rough user, don't buy this phone. (Remember a time when almost every phone was made of plastic)•The display is a lot better than OP 6T even though on paper they've the same display the color density per ppi is higher in Nord (One of the underrated feature for OP 2020 phones)•The phone is made in India even though the company is Chinese it is still employing people in India and if you're not a target of 25% increased unemployment rate, lucky you.•The Software is as fresh as it can get and I can't already wait for November to get Always-on-Display and Android 11.Cons-•The camera is performing great but I'm sure it's not flagship performance, instead of complaining I can wait for updates and as you can see in pixel series, software of the camera matters too.•After a week of usage I feel the battery is same as the 6T but as mentioned above Android 11 would most probably fix that.That's it for me, I think most bad reviews here are unjustified and doesn't give the a fair review to the phone. People using MI or Poco or Vivo or whatever, I don't think there's any company that listens to it's customers like OnePlus does. (Even Samsung can't move Brisby button even though everyone hates it) Look online and look for OP ideas website, the company genuinely cares about it's customer unlike most companies. Here you're paying for an almost flagship experience and the company delivers it exceptionally well. Hope my Review was helpful and it helps you enjoy your new phone\\n\", '\\n  Never thought OnePlus brand can degrade this low on camera quality. You will definitely be disappointed with the performance of both front and rear cameras. Instead of 2 at the front and 4 at the rear they should have given atleast on proper camera to do the job. Disappointed..why oneplus why...\\n', \"\\n  After using it for several days,I noticed some issues1) Image processing is taking time(more than usual)2) After clicking a image you need to keey your hand stable for a while, otherwise the image will get blurred3) Low light photography is very poor4) Battery is draining faster even in 60Hz refresh rate.5) Sometimes networks drops are there, you'll lost internet connection for seconds and it'll restore after it.But all of these issues can be resolved by update and OnePlus is very concerned about their customers,as they keeps asking for issues in their community page.Buy it if you're not a gamer or not into phography and want balanced and smooth device.\\n\", '\\n  Poor display ... .. also vibration slider not working properly ....Bad experience..

The display is amazing.2. Oxygen OS is really clean, good, and easy to use.3. The Alert Slider button is helpful.4. Charging is fast ( not as much as Realme X2 pro but quite fast)CONS -1. The camera is bad, really bad. Only on daylighting the back primary camera can take good pics, all the other cameras are useless in the back. Wide-angle lens shoots really soft pictures, you cant zoom or crop the picture or it turns grainy. Depth and macro are just place holders. They are of no good use.2. Performance is okayish, you won't feel any lag in normal usage, but scrolling through twitter feed or google news feels starts showing lags and jerks. Camera after clicking the picture ( after shutter sound, and a small image showing at the lower corner ), it still needs 1 more second to click the picture properly. you need to keep the camera in the same position even after clicking the pic for 1 more second or the pictures are blurry.3. Speaker is not good, high in volume but low in clarity, if you push the volume for more than 60% it starts cracking.4. Battery performance is not good either, it requires another round of charging by 8 PM ( without gaming) but my phone is defective and has some charging issue, not sure whether the battery performance is because of the same, waiting for a replacement .If you are ready to spend 28-30k and you really want OnePlus device and are ready to sacrifice with the sub-par camera setup, then go ahead else try to look out for other devices.\\n\", '\\n  Over all I am happy to be the owner of oneplus Nord but below some negative points please must see before buying if you are heavy userFingarprint reader is ok , camera is not upto mark for 30k mobileIf a say about life than its not good if you are using with 90h screen refresh rate and white screenBut battery is decent(good) if using with 60h refreshrate and dark modeI am not a heavy user but battery running for one day after doing settingsIf accidentally it is dropped due to plastic frame it will brake down not durable today 25 aug 20 happened with me\\n', '\\n  Loved the device! What OnePlus said it delivered. it\\'s snappy and feels fast.The Screen is Great!I got 5:30 SOT day 1 and it charged pretty fast as well (Poweroff - 50mins, Poweron - 60mins)I did a little stress test from my end running multiple heavy applications and running benchmarks as well, it\\'s temperature increased only about 3-4%, quite impressive.UFS 2 is a drag, and the cameras are overhyped, they are good, but not as advertised.Would suggest this phone to anyone coming from a mid-range device and want a flagship-like feel.The closest competitors for this device are -> Pixel 4a and iPhone SE.Lastly, \"Nord is an experience, not just any other mere device you buy\".\\n', '\\n  Worst product\\n', '\\n  A descent mobile....feels premium.....awesome display with 90 hrz referesh rate. Fingure scanner lightening fast. Front camera clarity is amazing however back camera needs some software improvement especially for low light photography and portrait mode. Fast charging takes approximately 35 minutes from 0 to 100. Design could be better with camera module at centre or square shape camera module at top left....better discharge faster....overall a good mobile phone.\\n', \"\\n  I ordered OnePlus Nord 12gb ram+ 256gb rom on 6th August morning and it reached to me on 10th August.The display of this phone is excellent, I just loved the movie experience will watching prime video, the colours were really asm.The speaker of this phone, not having a stereo speakers set up, but honestly the speaker is very loudThe camera of this phone:Under artificial lightRear pictures with both ultra wide and main camera are descent enough but the selfies lack detailing.Videos with rear main camera is good but not with ultra wide, it is just average and videos with front camera are just asm.Natural lightVideos and pictures with both cameras are really very good and has a good dynamic rangeThe nightscape and macro mode/camera are just waste, the main camera performs better than nightscape and macro cameraA suggestion that better use g cam for front camera and nightscape mode, pictures with g cam with front and nightscape are better than stock cameraThe pre-appplied screen protector has a descent quality and the back case quality is good.The charging speeds are excellent, I got 0-100 in 1 hr and about 0-65 in 30 mins.I just played coc and not pubg or cod or freefire on it, so don't know the about how the gaming performance, but I think it will have a descent gaming performance.The oxygen os is just smooth and I had a good experience with itThe connectivity with my tws is excellent, but just facing problem when I first connect it, automatically Amazon music starts playing the last played song by me, don't know what's the problem, hope OnePlus fixes it with update.There is know ipx rating, but u will not face any problem with minor issues and the bulid quality is nice, doesn't look that much premium as I expected.The weight of the phone is very less and it is easy to use it with one hand.I didn't faced any issue will calling, the inbulit microphone is nice.The 90 Hertz display is good.And yes, it has green tinting issue but u can only see it at minimum brightness while seeing something in dark mode type and in a dark room, it is not that much greenish type, honestly it's very very much light coloured (green), I just tested the screen, but I didn't saw tinting issues in normal usage, I think the the tinting issue is just negligible for u to buy it.All the things are good except some camera modes, and hope OnePlus would fix it with an update, till then u can use G Cam + Stock cam.All the above it's a very good balanced phone having all the needy features with a good quality at low quality and plus it is a 5G phone.If u want a good and balanced phone under 25k to 30k, OnePlus nord is the best, do not even look at the other brands like redmi, realme,etc.And if u want a phone where ur main prefrence is only and only gaming then OnePlus nord is not for u, checkout the other high performance phones with 800 series chip.Overall the OnePlus Nord is a very good phone with all the best features u want and a descent gaming experience.And it is a value for money smartphone!And I ordered the blue marble colour, which I just liked the most and the design of the phone is also good.\\n\", \"\\n  USP of 5G but not even running at a level of 3G. I'm so frustrated of this phone. Being everything fast and snappy, if you're restricted on connectivity, all the fun fades away. The network connection is so lost away, its very hard to connect to the internet. Although its faster than the usual 4G but only after its connected. I literally feel of breaking this phone several times a day. This reminds me of very old tech products which used to work only when you slap or hit it hard. Pathetic!\\n\", \"\\n  One plus Nord has some issues like Google home search and as well as Google assistant doesn't work some time and Phone dial 📞 shows updating.Call recording were not getting saved.\\n\", \"\\n  There is no relationship quite like the one between me and my dad,Today on the Prime Day early morning we had our delivery agent standing at our door steps with the gift i ordered for my ¨DAD¨.I had been thinking of gifting something special to my dad on his birthday..I was one of the first ones who were waiting for the pre-booking sale to open for :-OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage)Amazing product !!

Don't look the reviews, their standards are way high. For an average user, you will definately get a flagship level experience.Performance awesome.Display is beutiful to look at.The best thing about this phone is you feel good while writing something,the touch response is top-tier.You will definately get phones much cheaper than this with better spec sheet but let me tell you, having a oneplus phones feels good, buying a mi or oppo phone of 50000 will still be mi and oppo phones as they are known for their cheap phones.And OnePlus phones last and I mean they last long. I previously had OnePlus X(5 years old) and it still works fine exept for battery. Hence you can easily use this phone for atleast for 5 years. That for me is good enough.\\n\", '\\n  Very very bad performance , i upgrade to my mi a1 that was brilliant Mobile the one plus Nord is bad performance and camera fully unclear photos front and rear camera also\\n', '\\n  After one month usage I am writing this review.Finger print reader is ok ok.Battery life is short but also charges faster.Main camera quality is ok.

Not good for multitasking.Overall just ok, not as good as described.No automatic call recording option.\\n', \"\\n  A lot of people have given their expert opinions here so I'm just gonna address a few things.1)Display:- Yes there is a tint issue but I feel Oxygen Os 10.5.7.AC01DA has solved it to an extent.My recommended setting isDisplay calibration>Advanced>Display P3 and tone it down to cold.2)Camera:- I seriously don't know why people are soooo critical about the cameras. I know it's not that great but it's not that bad either. People are paying half the price of one plus flagships and expect the same quality(though both 1+8 and nord have the same primary camera.lol). Of course they are gonna bring improvements but  it's not going to exceed some people's expectations.3)Battery life:- It's not that great. It's mainly due to that 90hz refresh rate.P.S:-Not attaching any photos there are enough of them here 😂\\n\", \"\\n  I've been following this phone to buy ever since they started the project hoping it would be good...WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT..1. A Flagship level gaming performance2. A Flagship Quality camera3. That it will be super easy living without 3.5mm because I still find it a bit difficult to get used to(but it's a worthy trade-off)WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT...1.  A Flagship quality performance in terms of day to day usage because the bloatfree OxygenOS makes sure you do2. A beautiful Display with a must have refresh rate3. All day battery with proper fast charge...( A lot of people might be expecting a better battery life but if you are using 90hz it will be like this no matter which company you use )4. I meant proper because most of the phones get hot while fast charging but this didn'tOverall It is a phone which is a perfect daily driver with a good gaming performance and If you believe a phone is more than what the spec sheet says then this is for you.P.S. Disappointed with Amazon delivery...Preordered phone took 10 days after shipping to get delivered after shipping while an usual order takes 3 days.\\n\", \"\\n  I recently bought this phone after going thru the great praises from all the paid media.  The very first shot from the so raved camera setup bursted the bubble. (I am Apple fan and will be Apple period and there is no turning back this was my last attempt). The Quality of image is so much doctored that it actual makes everything look so plastic. Tried GCAM too but that too not upto the mark of what iphone SE of first generation delivers. It just  mediocre camera and output is HORRIBLE.Felt so damn cheated.To be honest even the Redmi phone used by one of my known gives better results with their two lense camera. If anyone is planning to buy this one please don't go for it , there are many better options at cheaper price. and if u can shell out few bucks more go for IPHONE SE trust me u will not regret it.\\n\", '\\n  The look and feel is very good.. the phone is very compact, handy and also felt light weight. I was previously using Asus 5Z and Vivo Z1x..First time user of Oxygen OS and I am loving it.. no unwanted ads and apps. Butter smooth performance. There are a few Facebook related apps which can be deleted by connecting the phone with laptop.. u can find this info in xda developers website.The 765G processor does a decent job.. I play games (PubG and COC) for about 3-4 hours a day.. and was spending more time on the camera for the past 3 days..Battery drains fast as I have nothing else to do other than fiddling with this phone all the time.. once the work life becomes normal the battery should be enough for 1 day.. as of now am charging for 2 times a day. Charging is fast with the 30W charger.I am a fan of black colour and first time I purchased a different colour the Blue Marble.. I was initially thought of canceling the order to swith the colour to Gray Onyx.. later thought I can try something new.. good that I did not cancel the order.. The Blue Marble is fantastic and gives a premium look..For those who expect a very fast shutter speed and image optimization dont go for Nord.. it normally takes about 2 seconds for the image to optimize and then display the actual image in portrait mode.. in nightscape mode it will take about 5 seconds.. I dont mind waiting for 2 or 5 seconds though.. There is a blink in slow-motion videos when you are in low light but I think it is the case with all the phones. The pictures are very nice.. I am sharing few pictures here.. The 2MP Macro lens could have been removed.. there is no use of it..As far as Gaming, I did not find any lag or heating issue.. if u r going to use the plain case that comes with the mobile, then u might feel a slight discomfort playing pubg.Display is very nice.. I did not have any Tint issue with my device or may be it was fixed with the recent update that was rolled out.\\n', '\\n  I had ordered a OnePlus Nord from Amazon on 6th of August. It was delivered on 8th of August. After using it for a week the display was distorted. I took it to the service center and I was told that this is a manufacturing defect and will be replaced in 10 days. I  submitted my device to the service center on 17th of August. Meanwhile when I tried to track the replacement, I tried to reach out to OnePlus Customer Support via email, chat service and call. I was unable to get any response regarding replacement after 15 emails, 10 calls and 10 interactions with the chat service to escalate the issue to a higher authority in the company. On September 3rd (after 17 days) I received replacement but I was not given any acknowledgment for the replacement. It turned out that the replacement was also defective with display issues. Now they are not even responding to me regarding replacement of 2nd defect device. One of the worst customer support services on this planet Earth. Buyers beware and proceed with caution. I will never buy a OnePlus device ever again till I exist.\\n', \"\\n  I have got severe display issue with green tint on 75% of left screen and the brightness is abnormall high on the left side.

Don't get distracted by the screen tinting issue. It's yhe Amoled property which is nothing to do with the quality of the product and it won't be hamper your day to day usage.

And above all 90hz refresh rate with oxygen OS is a total bliss and no other android will give you this heavenly experience. The battery is draining a little quick but I think it's because of 90hz and maybe battery optimization will be done in future OTA updates.

Nord is absolutely a good choice for a best android experience and the gray onyx colour is so good than Blue marble .the 90hz display experience looks like a flagship . The wide angle camera is best at its rate .overall 8.7/10\\n', '\\n  Super phone in this time this rang All in one....in oneplus nord\\n', '\\n  Oneplus created the hype and asked people to prebook it. I prebooked on 18th July and then again on 28th July and received the product on 9th August. I mean then why that prebook drama.After that the phone comes out to be an average phone. They claimed that it has flagship level camera, trust me 10k phones click better photos. Above all that no clarification on prebooked benefits and how to claim. Shame\\n', '\\n  Received the product today, my few cents:Pros:1) The processor is superfast and touch feel is really awesome.2) Back Camera is like any other 20k+ phone camera, good, but front camera quality is good during vide calls3) Build design is good and the new OS features are also good. Not gone thru all of them, the ones that are explored are good4) Battery - 100% Charged in the morning 10AM, after 8 hours at 6PM, 60% left which means it might come for 1+ day. Since the setup operations takes lots of juice, you can judge on your own.Cons:1) Fingerprint Setup is pathetic, the old fingerprint sensor is way better then this on screen one. You have to literally scroll your finger in all 8 dimensions for about 16 times before it completes the setup. Its lame in terms of technoligical advancement.2) Fingerprint recognization is okay.. not as good as the old sensors in 3T and other OnePlus models.\\n', \"\\n  It doesn't seem like that camera is stolen from OnePlus 8.... Worst experience with camera...this phone is about nothing , but only the hype they have created in the market...it's better to ban these Chinese phones... I'm not even satisfied with the display... It doesn't look like a amoled... I heard a lot about oneplus., So I've tried it for the first time, but totally different from what I've heard... Waste of money....in this segment (30k) we r getting a lot better phones... Think twice before you buy this phone..\\n\", \"\\n  \\xa0Loved the size and weight of the phone. The metallic finish and slim body makes it feel top of the world, for such a budget phone packed with multiple features that i shall be exploring on the go. The back cover is quite decent but okay but the most important fact is it has a waterproof protection over the charging point, which is the best part from a usability aspect. Above all the picture quality is very natural and most importantly just like iPhone without any additional filters that takes away the charm. Other than than that it is paacked with multiple camera features, that'll blow your mind.Most importantly the broad smile and happiness over my daughters face was priceless. What else could a proud dad expect from such a valueable product.\\n\", \"\\n  Okay. So, firstly, horrible delivery by Amazon india. I placed the order on 30th July. It got shipped on 12th August and was delivered by 16th. This review will be completely unbiased and will come from an user who used vivo v15 pro beforehand.Like all of you, I also believed that Nord did not live up to the hype by seeing it get criticised by reviewers. But, trust me, this midranger gives you the same premium feeling as you would expect in a flagship device. (Not joking, it's beautiful). Obviously if you come from a device like OnePlus 6,7,8 it's a downgrade, no doubt. I wanted to buy the 7t for it's features and processor, but I bought the Nord. Why ?1) 10k cheaper than 7t.2) Better selfie camera composition.3) Same bloatware free oxygenOS.4) 90Hz fluid AMOLED display. (trust me guys, it's buttery smooth. I found it brighter than my vivo and way smoother due to the 90Hz panel. You will get addicted to the display).5) sd 765g : Day to day tasks like swiping , moving through apps is as fluid as found on higher premium OnePlus devices. (I compared the swiping speeds with 7t pro, it could catch up with the 7t pro). I'm not a heavy gamer. I usually keep my gaming sessions short like for 10 mins at a stretch and I'm done. I noticed zero frame drops playing COD, it ran very smooth. No lags.5) Build quality : I don't know why so much people are making a fuss over the plastic frame. I used an unibody cheap plastic built v15 pro and coming from that, the NORD felt VERY premium in my hands. It is really compact, inhand feel is awesome. You can feel it's a premium device when you hold it. Stop believing crap like the phone feels less premium due to it's plastic frame. We wouldn't even know it was plastic unless it was clarified by OnePlus.6) User interface: Coming from a trash funtouchOS, the oxygenOS is heavenly. It runs apps very smoothly and really fast. No complaints.7) I don't know how many people would want to know but the ultrawide angle selfie cam is pretty useful. It helps.8) Super linear bottom firing mono speaker: The speaker has way more better clarity and loudness than my v15 pro. Yes, it's definitely not loud as the 7t /8/7t pro. But it's loud enough. Would not complain.Here's what I do miss tho:-1) I really miss the headphone jack. I don't have money to buy TWS rn. So I do, dearly miss the headphone jack.2) I expected ufs 3.0 storage. But 2.1 is okay, you wouldn't notice if you aren't that nitpicky.3) The camera quality I would say , for an all-arounder star device like the Nord, it's okayish. It gives you really good day light pictures with decent details. It won't disappoint you in any aspect if daylight pictures are concerned. The pictures look natural, not artificially boosted and punched like vivo phones. The ultra wide sensor gives you really good colors and you won't really find any difference until you zoom into that picture for details. I could get very good(if not the best) portrait shots and the macro camera, well it's useless. Don't use it. Overall, I know OnePlus will definitely improve the camera on this through regular software updates.4) unpopular opinion : Even if a premium phone with better cameras and a flagship processor comes out in the market, I would prefer oxygenOS rather than choosing any of the realme, miuis,etc .\\n\", \"\\n  Chennai, தமிழ்நாடு, India.I was worried about negative reviews on battery, camera, and display issues but I don't find any. It delivers what is promised. After 3 hours of handling, I wanted to write a quick review who are ordered and worried just like me because of negative reviews.I pre-ordered the OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage). After a long wait, it was delivered today 13 Aug 2020. After 5 years of OnePlus 2 I now finally upgraded to OnePlus Nord. Highly satisfied with Nord!!I will post an update after a week's usage.\\n\", '\\n  Hello,I got this phone on 3rd of August, one day before its official launch, and it has been wonderful experience.Although when I opened the box I did see a bubble on the screen underneath so that took be aback (Its still there).The phone charges in appx 60 mins (With more usage gradually it will increase no doubt abt that). But being a moderate user the battery lasts for about 1.5 days which is quite good.As far as performance is concerned this is phone is much better than Google Pixel 4A or Iphone SE in the same price bracket. Hands down. Apps open up really fast no lagging at all. No heating issues as well till now.\\n', \"\\n  Bought this one after seeing the specs online and price looked so good. But it didn't meet my expectations. If you're a frequent user , gamer or does something like plays poker in mobile then 100% this is not the phone for you, the reason I'm saying this because of its battery backup though it claims 4135 battery but it lasts only 4-5 hours of continuous uses after a full charge and worst case is in any activity wheather you're playing games, watching videos, talking it drains the same amount of battery. Ofcourse the fast charger is there but why would someone charge their phone 3 times a day. The could have definitely offer better battery backup. Camera is really average don't expect it to capture shots. The only thing i like about the phone is it's screen. Sound quality is pretty good too. Overall a 3star. I hope they fix the battery issue somehow.\\n\", \"\\n  Best phone under 30k. It's a common sense that at this price one plus would not provide all features of one plus 8. Some YouTubers also speak irrelevant things about this phone. They are blindly against the phone. But, as per my opinion it's a great deal till now in phone market in India if one considers all aspects of the phone.\\n\", '\\n  Search, compare, compare, and compare again to all its competitors. Nord will stand out always. You need to understand that this is an upper midrange flagship and not a complete premium phone. Unless you are Rahul Gandhi, you should be able to understand that you cannot expect a complete premium experience but Nord gets you as close as possible to it in terms of features, build, display, and after-sales support. So, without thinking twice, go ahead with this. I have been a part of 1+ community for almost 7 years now, and I can definitely say if you are on a tight budget and cannot afford Oneplus 8/8pro, THIS IS THE ONE YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ALWAYS.\\n', '\\n  It’s not what every YouTuber is saying. It’s absolutely not like the magic Oneplus One was. The other two siblings of OnePlus Nord I have used as my secondary devices were Oneplus C and Oneplus 3T and both were amazing devices and are still with me. NORD is light weight good looking phone with ordinary AMOLED Screen and speaker.  I am not a gamer so it doesn’t matter how it performs there. No complaints from camera either but nothing great about it too. I also made a mistake of buying it in blue color. It’s so jarring that it started irritating me in a day. Another blunder- I started using blue sandstone case and I felt like throwing up. Now it’s in black color sandstone case and looks okay. So I suggest buy its black/grey color. There is no option of returning it unfortunately. And if you are coming from iPhone don’t even go close to it. You will hate it the way I do.\\n', '\\n  Straight to the point phone is good , ordered on 28th July , in promoting OnePlus saying coustomer with get gift box who purchase in before 31st , received OnePlus waiting for  one week , no information from OnePlus and Amazon about it. Amazon saying we are not mentioned it in our site contact OnePlus, tried to contact OnePlus but no response from OnePlus it connecting thought mail and live chat. What is the next step ?\\n', \"\\n  Nice phone camera also good and oxgen os and display is the main usp of this phone. Pubg gameplay is good but it supports smooth ultra fps that's the only con but in ultra graphics u got 95% of time (40 fps) lock which is good. And OnePlus said that they are talking with the tencent for extreme graphics. Hopefully waiting.Nice phone overall. Thanks\\n\", \"\\n  The camera quality is not expected from one plus. This quality can be achieved in a 10k budget phone. Never expected this from One plus. You won't survive in Indian market if you do like that in nord using cheap hardwares. Many people were excited about one plus but this one is not upto the one plus standard so please don't buy.\\n\", '\\n  I got this toy yesterday after placing pre order on 28th july.I was expecting more powerful battery life and camera quality. Not up to the mark but okay its okay to manage in a mid range gadgetOverall happy after the 1 day usage. Finger print scanner response very smoothly and provide fast unlocking experience of the device. Warp charginng is excellent. Mobile is very handy having a rich display with 90 Hertz refresh rate.Go for it if you only want to spend 30k on some mobile phone.\\n', '\\n  Everything is just fantastic in this price point this is the best phone because the brand OnePlus needs no introductionGreat displayLong battery lifeOxygen OS is superbb.Loved this device\\n', '\\n  Bed product and performance no return policy not happy to this product\\n', \"\\n  Issue list:1. During phone call screen get locked and you have to unlock again to do anything like disconnect call.2. After every call you will get notification of phone getting updated.3. Battery drain drastically. From 100% to 90% in 7 mins. (Not using any heavy apps. By just screen on).4. Heating issues. Heats for just using messages, what's up and phone calls too. While charging it heats upto 45° C. So battery is going to get damaged very very soon.5. Call logs missing. Last week call logs are also missing.6. Bluetooth disconnect issues with headphones,buds,health tracker watches or any other Bluetooth devices. Quite embarrassing.7. YouTube videos stuck halfway,not because of internet. That means video(visual stuck) and voice goes on. Like old TVs.8. Wifi speed is low. Laptop shows 40 speed and Nord speed is 18 speed. Other mobile shows 38 speed.9. Messages will be delivered late. OTP get received after few hours sometime.10. Only few apps are permitted to have parallel apps. Mostly very generic. But if you need any specific app you can't.11. Charger and red cable type C pin also  heats up high during charging.12. Camera do not open sometimes.13. You have to Click and wait for photo to be captured without blur both front and back cameras.14. Even if you do point 13. Still photos are not upto mark and night photos not atall upto mark.15. OnePlus Nord is not tested mobile in Market. OnePlus don't agree but if it is tested then why there are so many issues.Deficiency list:1. No 3.5mm Jack.2. Display tint issues. 90% devices have it.3. No external memory slot.4. No infrared to use as a remote of your TV and music system,smart light at home.5. OnePlus Oxygen OS Contacts and Phone dialer apk is missing. And Google contacts and dialer has lot of issues and they are not stable.6. OnePlus Oxygen OS message apk is missing.7. Oxygen OS phone contacts, dialer and messages apks are actually signature of Oxygen OS without which Oxygen OS is clearly incomplete like half meal.8. Plastic body.9. No Automatic call recording. Big deficiency.When talked to OnePlus they gave 100 reasons for deficiencies on this OnePlus Nord. No reason is sounds satisfactory. Mostly every reason OnePlus gave is silly excuse.This is a consolidated list. If you see anything missing please add in comments.All my issues I have raised with OnePlus bit nothing turned out to be resolved.Visited  OnePlus services center nothing resolved. Discussed  with OnePlus customer care, feedbacks given complaints given for each issue given to them with logs, screenshot and what all OnePlus has asked for. I have spent many many hours to inform OnePlus about each and every issue of the above mentioned issues.So please don't reply back to me to reach OnePlus team. This post it here because OnePlus did absolutely nothing to resolve these.Dirty truth of the scenario.\\n\", \"\\n  \\xa0I found so many glitches in this phone. Instagram doesn't work properly, the phone gets hung while using different apps. It's not a fun phone at all. I'm totally disappointed. For your information, I still haven't inserted my sim cards for it to be this bad\\n\", \"\\n  I was very exciting to buy this mobile. But later realized that it's not worth the money.Pros:*Oxygen OS*90hz refreshing display*Smooth operationCons:Poor battery backupUnexpected poor cameraLess color variantsBottomline: Expected much better product especially camera and battery but it lags both. Realme X2 pro is better option than this.Updated:It's a total waste off money, pls don't buy it, lot of issues are there in mobile.Calls are not hearing properly most of the time.Battery backup is very very poorCamera is totally awful, it's like 10000rs mobile, not worth for 30K.\\n\", '\\n  #Camera Quality is not up to the mark when compared to  previous OnePlus previous models and generates lots of noise.#Bugs were there when I did start to record video using the front camera with a resolution of 4K@60 fps and it got resolved once I updated to the latest OS version.#Green & Purple tint issue is clearly visible when you operate the phone in dark mode below 30% brightness.#People who prefer 6GB + 64 GB variant must keep in mind that OnePlus Nord does not have an expandable memory slot. So the best option would be 8GB or 12 variant.#Please use a good mobile case as the frame is made up of plastic, which has high chances of getting damaged and it is not waterproof and dust proof certified.#Gamers should not consider this phone as the battery drains out quickly and there is also heating issue.\\n', '\\n  Im a one plus user for past few years and this is the worst product iv seen.. the pros of this is its vibrant colour and price..Cons. Had problem with fingerprint sensor, its not water proof. As after 15 days of use moisture started forming inside both the camera lens.So i tried to aproach one plus customer care for conrinuous 3 days and it was so hectic stil they cudnt connect me to any customer executive of theirs. Then i aproached the customer care of one plus near me.. i.e. in mapusa goa. They said tht one plis is not providing them any support so they have shut down al the services temporarily.This is the first time i faced so much issues with the phone and one plus services..The only option left now is to throw this phone into garbage.. and go for some other phone .Totaly disapointed.\\n', \"\\n  It's best product...OnePlus is a brand and...Nord is a new direction...camera quality is better but not as good as 8...and battery life is quite good and it's charges 40 min 0 to 100....it gaves the best performance....and here is 90hrtz refresh rate then it's best but...if u used 60htz refresh rate phone then u will see definitely the difference... Face unlock is so fast but fingerprint scanner is not so good...and AMOLED display is the best... U must need to but this product....and now new direction comes in my life I m happy to get it..😋😋\\n\", '\\n  I am writing this review after 1 day of use. First of all the battery charging is really mind blowing and can charge the full battery between 65-75 minutes.Camera quality is good and good stabilization providing a premium feel in videography.Low light photography is the place we need to improve I believe.Sometimes I think this phone is overpriced but the Oxygen OS experience will remove that thinking from our mind.\\n', \"\\n  The moment you unbox this device you will feel this is a high tier device. one cannot easily find out that its made of plastic with gorilla glass 5 protection. The device is sleek and looks premium. i do like the slight gradient on its back. The camera bump is quite pronounced and definitely requires a casing which can prevent from smudges and other issues.it runs on android 10 out of the box  as expected for any modern android device currently available.the experience is smooth without any stuttering. 765G does performs well.coming to the displayDisplay is neutral and not overly saturated as compared to the OnePlus 6 that I have. But i must say the display is extremely well optimized for true to life colors. my OnePlus 6 kills the details when i run HDR videos which is not the case here. you will see the details and the texture well preserved in the nord as compared to op6. 90hz is becoming the new norm for  even in an entry level android and thats something which adds up to the smooth ui of the device.since i do have a k20 as well handy, the display of this device is no less vibrant and is vivid.another important criteria for me is camera. Its well balanced camera. the main camera borrows the same camera sensor i.e. the imx586 from OnePlus 8 which inturn has been used in the previous years OnePlus 7 series .  the colors are punchy, gets you through most situations without hassle. i do not use the macro sensor which is an utterly useless 2. megapixel camera. wide angle does its job well and thats an 8 MP. You do get depth sensor for portraits. Portraits are good if not the best . the night mode is improved as well compared to previous OnePlus. the selfies are a tad softer and i feel it can be little sharper. these companies force the skin smoothing on us. but some of us do not like this and would like to disable. Probably there could be an option which am yet to explore.  the wide angle in front camera is a nice addition for group selfies.coming to the audio is good. the loudspeaker sounds decent. its not a dual speaker on this front but a bottom firing single speaker which does it's job. the most painful part of today's devices which is almost like a plague is removal of the 3.5 mm jack. i dont know whats the real difficulty in adding a tiny little port. my OnePlus 6 has a 3.5 mm jack ans yet it maintains a slimmer profile than the nord.  its an annoying experience to carry around type c to 3.5mm adapters and not that u have too many good choices for a type c earphones. not all of like those bluetooth earphones which are quite a trend these daysso i do not have much to say about gaming.am not a gamer hence i cannot comment on this. but most likely the phone will be able to handle games like  pubg , asphalt 9 without hickups as seen on other tech reviews. moreover G model processors are wel optimized for games with higher clock speed set.thats pretty much that i use on a phone.i had options like Redmi K20 pro and also Realme X50 superzoom. K20 pro is definitely a device to consider if you are ok with an year old device. but u do get a flagship grade processor which is a powerful option as compared to 765G. but u lose out on 5G if u really care, for which we are not ready yet. u do get risinf camera which could be a concern in long run. but the non pro k20 with us is still doing fine. and few do not like the miui.but miui does have its own perks. I do like the option of lockscreen wallpapers which change frequently from the mi library and the content is rich.the k20 camera can be better optimized is what i feel.Realme x50 super zoom on other side is also a well packaged device however i wanted to go for a device with a Amoled since i do a lot of media consumption on my device where as the x50 had an LCD and one cannot get deep blacks and contrast on an LCD.most importantly i have been a longtime user of ghe oxygen OS. in simple words it's the no non sense UI and just as good as the Google's Vanilla Android UI. its blazing fast, updates get rolled out as soon as google releases.at last i had to chose a blend of everything for the money that i pay and nord was the device that fullfilled this. So in Nord you have 6Gb+128GB variant 25k which is coming in September, 8+128GB at 28k  and 12+256GB at 30k. at 2k increase i was getting a 4GB additional RAM and double the storage which made sense to choose this over other two variants.so who is this device for? i think its for some one who wants a flagship grade camera, a good punchy display for media consumption and social media,  but do not really wish to spend 40k plus but still get a flagship experience with few compromises in processor which is not a flagship but can still get you a snappy performance at a much lower price. you are also future proofed with this device ready for 5G.\\n\", '\\n  This phone is perfect for someone who uses it for casual use like facebook WhatsApp and some games and other apps and nothing intensive and with some pictures here and there..Built wise: 8/10Camera: 7/10Speakers 7/10Display 9/10 (mine had no tint issue)Battery 6/10 could be optimised with updateSo if you are not a very heavy user than just go for it..phone feels very good in hand with a perfect weight balance... although pubg runs fine with smooth ultra but I played only 1 TDM XD.\\n', \"\\n  Mobile overall ok, but I'm really disappointed with OnePlus cheep publishing stunts for both budget tv and phone, that's the reason for one star review. Camara is flicking when we take vedios of fire/ smoke, I took videos/pics on house warming all of them I took while yagnam were flicking and blure, OnePlus connect is not so usefull with the OnePlus TV, keyboard not opening, when we play vedio audio and video are nonsync. Front cam also not soo good, I like the fingrt print point and switch. They could have give option to the user for wired headset, cz in wfh times talking calls hours and hours, don't think soo wireless ones will serve purpose.\\n\", \"\\n  This is all what you expect from a 2020 smartphone! Everything seems really perfect!The cellphone feels more premium that what we actually pay for it!The user interface is really smart and snappy and it feels really nice while using the cellphone.This is my second oneplus device and I am really happy with it!The camera is really impressive...don't go with the negative YouTube reviews... It is really a flagship camera and you would love every single shot captured through it. The HDR is perfect and the edge detection is really impressive. And trust me the night mode is really ultra amazing!The only problem is that I just expected the battery to be bit more long lasting...it is not that bad but it's not that good either..but it gets charged quickly so it's not a big deal for me as well...but on a regular usage I think the battery performance is not that good and that's the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.I could really say that you can choose oneplus nord over oneplus 8 or 8 pro because there's not much of a difference in both of them. Personally I've compared oneplus 8 and 8 pro in real life with my nord and I still think nord is worth every penny and you could skip on 8 or 8 pro and go for the OnePlus Nord anytime!\\n\", '\\n  Display tint issue is there. Display turns pink and green on low brightness in dark mode.\\n', '\\n  For fingerprint sensor it has a great job, and battery life could have been better (lets wait until the next update) but the major i got dissapointed is its front camera. Though it has sony 32MP camera it takes a picture like 8MP camera or 12MP camera i didnt like it that much, though i am not a camera user still for 32MP sony camera it could have done miraculous job i guess. An coming to back(rear) camera i felt its good but still for sony 48MP camera it can do much better job, I hope that in the future updates they may change all the camera performance(both rear and front). Lastly the smoothness, I loved it, the way they have made it is incredible and its very handy too, but one thing that is lagging is the price is too hectic for mid range but still I loved it. Except for cameras and battery life, you can buy it eye closed....\\n', \"\\n  I bought the OnePlus phone first time and I bought12gb 256gb varient of this phone..I like every things on this smartphone like 5g ready, camera, oxygen os, performance is mediocore.The Software of this device is best in the game. I like it because it has the functionality like stock Android and also highly customisable. You can get software updates very quickly and fastly. It's 90hz screen makes the experience more smooth and snappy.I actually love photography so it is a very good phone to me. It's camera have OIS supported , you can get very good daytime shots with it. And may be mediocore night time shots But not as the level of flagship but this doesn't bother me because with the power of Lightroom I can bring those photos to the another level.The two things I didn't like that it's battery life it could be little bit better and also. It's display have some little tint issue.But that's not a big problem for me.Below are the attached sample shots from this device.\\n\", \"\\n  This is a normal daily driver from oneplus. Not so good, not so bad.Pros:- Good design, feels premium even though the body is plastic- Good performance, no lag observed- Good call quality and music quality on headphones (compared to my oneplus 3)- Good signal reception and wifi speed.- Does not feel too heavy in hand and does not feel slippery with the case provided.- Smooth UICons: - Camera, this is is biggest negative of this mobile. I am not sure if it is the hardware or software, but it is bad. I feel my oneplus 3 produced better pictures with main camera. I do not see good colour reproduction, pictures appear little dull and low light picture is grainy. My family member's oneplus 6T is much better compred to nord's main camera. There is a huge huge difference in picture quality between 6T and this. I don't know what oneplus have done here. Selfie camera is also not good, oneplus 6T produces much better images. So if you are a photo freak, this is a big NO for you. Hope oneplus fixes it through software update. I am not much into photography with mobile, so I am fine here even though little disappointed.- Screen is not up to the mark. AMOLED with 90Hz disaply, really? Again I can compare it with oneplus 6T, and it looks better when playing games, videos or photos.- Battery drains faster without actually doing anythingOverall I do not feel this meets the standard set by oneplus, they have cut corners heavily, mainly camera and screen. This is just good enough as a daily driver, nothing great. I have gone for oneplus mainly for its support for good range of LTE frequency bands which can be used in countries like USA, compared to others in same price range. You will have better options for the price if your main concern is camera and you do not travel much to foreign countries.Update: After recent software update, camera is better and battery is not draining as before. Looks like it is improving. Giving 4 star.\\n\", \"\\n  From opening up the box to setting it up and using it, OnePlus Nord provided a delightful experience, be it in terms of the fluidity or performance. As expected from OnePlus, it was a breeze to update the OS, apps and the UX was top notch. Warp charge 30T worked as advertised, topping up the phone pretty quickly. The camera performance was decent although OnePlus should have skipped on the gimmic of numbers and gone with just two good ones at the back. In my limited testing for two days, battery life was above average, netting me 7 hours of screen on time with location and auto brightness on, using only social networking apps and light games. This is bound to get better as the phone learns your usage habits and accomodates accordingly. The most unfortunate part was quality control for the display, a pink tint that covered about 25% of the right side of Nord's display under 50% brightness. It was terrible and noticable even inside a well lit room, provided the screen was under 50% brightness. This forced me to return this otherwise lovely phone as it was a deal-breaker. I'd still like to place orders in future to try my luck in what seems like a display lottery as the phone experience is rather well balanced. It's a recommended purchase provided you get one with a good display, otherwise return it.\\n\", \"\\n  The phone got delivered today, it was quite a long wait as it was a preorder. I bought this phone for my father and playing around with it I guess this would be the best option for him. He's an enthusiast photographer, enjoys video and movies on youtube, a lot of multitasking and calls going through the day.The phone feels light in hand, not something bulky, though the structure is plastic but holding it in your hand or looking at it trust me you won't get the plastic feel. The fingerprint scanner is too quick and responsive.Charging was quite fast(26% to 100% in 45 minutes), the display is superb, clear and hell smooth (thanks to 90hz), speakers are loud too produces a crisp and soothing sound (please dont expect the performance of high-end speaker)The camera is good, captures a good amount of details in both 43MP and 12MP mode. The colours feel natural, autofocus was nice too as per the price tag but definitely not what they advertise it as one plus 8 camera. The camera needs more tweaks. Macro and depth sensor is ok nothing great or to be proud of.NOTE: Heavy Gamers this is not for you if you are looking something for long term.Thanks to one plus for this but yes gotta go you guys did overhyped the promotion, a good strategy must say.\\n\", '\\n  Product is good but not upto that typical OnePlus mark.....feels more lyk oppo vivo one\\n', \"\\n  Well what do you know, after much anticipation, I finally received my oneplus nord. thanks to amazon for striving to deliver even during these trying times.without much further ado lets get down to the nitty-gritty as am not much into writing reviews.First of all gave only three stars as it is kinda hit and miss.> Battery is ok with average usage but heavy users will be disappointed... wrap charge does a wonderful job as described and charges the device really fast.>Camera is so so .... 48 mp takes good shots but that's about it as the rest is average at best ..macro is the worst.>Finger print scanner and face unlock works just fine.>Had no issues with display. videos are crisp... youtube and netflix videos especially hdr contents are a joy to watch.> wifi and internet connectivity is good especiall with dual connect.>Microphone quality is ok and cell reception is also good.Thats the ok part ... now comes some of the bad part> As in the headlines there are some serious issues with bluetooth connectivity, All bluetooth devices you name it... fit bit, audio etc etc  gets disconneted frequently as well as sometimes it is a pain to pair sometimes not pairing at all, have tried the bluetooth devices in other phones and laptop and they work just fine.. why am I making this a big thing...... because one plus did not include a headphone jack period and i love listening to music!!!! i dont know whether this is a software or hardware issue ... have installed the latest updates so will have to wait for the next update to know whether it will get corrected or not.>The speakers on the phone are mediocrewill update after using it for a month or so (hopefully my impression of the device will change... keeping fingers crossed)Now you choose whether to buy or not as there are other good phones out there.>overall performance is good (not excellent)Update:Bluetooth issues solved with updates, amazed at OnePlus frequent updates, camera performing much better now, have been using the phone for about a month now.4 stars\\n\", '\\n  All rumours like green tint , display issue at low light condition , battery backup is less , takes more time to charge were absolutely WRONG.OnePlus lovers can go for it without any second thought.Tested almost 10days to give exact review...Display is good., 90Hz refresh rate is awesome, no tint issue at all brighness levels, loudness of speaker is good (no stereo), charges less than an hour(warp charging), good battery backup almost a day (without gaming) .Only issue I faced is with OnePlus z series bluetooth headset gets disconnected in between calls and audio playback. Hope this will also resolve soon.\\n', \"\\n  The phone was hyped so much that I decided not to wait and pre-book the device but to my utter dismay the day I received the device I noticed that the screen on dim brightness started flickering a bit upon which I raised the issue with Amazon, I thought that it was just some minor issue which the influencers were talking about and might get rectified with a software update. The update did happened but the issue still remained but it didn't stop there, to add insult to injury the phone automatically got formatted and all my data got lost! I literally rued my decision of ordering the phone in a hurry.\\n\", '\\n  An awesome phone for the price. Simply great. The camera is not that bad as described by others and in review videos. If you are planning to buy a phone with a budget of upto 30k go for it. No other brand gives you a 12|256 variant for this price. The phone is awesome. You wont feel the difference between a flagship processor and this one while using.\\n', '\\n  The front camera is pathetic, blurness in photos like ordinary low quality pictures, its not worth giving 28k for blur photos which is basic need of everyone. For front camera photos whether its day light or low light its too bad, sad to see oneplus degrading its brand image by creating such a hype on this phone and manufacturing such poor quality. i think oneplus forget to test the camera before launching it, or they just want to bluff the customer by name......... u can get more good camera phone in this rangeRear camera is good, macro is pathetic its like vga camera, in day light condition rear camera is good but in low light poor quality, you can go for other phones in this price range for better experience in photos.Battery drains too quicklySoftware is good\\n', \"\\n  This phone is good but few things disappointed me. Please see the following matrix given below:1. Build quality: 4.5/5 ( it does not have the metal frame)2.

Camera: 2.5/5 ( eventhough it has 48 MP with Quad Cam setup, pictures are not detailed, it a average camera even after the software update; specially 2MP macro lens sucks; video quality is very nice; camera app user experience is not exciting.6.

A lot of bugs like camera crashing, photos not showing in gallery ,overheating after only 25min streaming,night mode error . already shared logs with the OnePlus team no fix as of now even after 5 updates still the same problems2)  on an average only 5 hours of screen on time, doesn't look like 4000mah battery have to charge twice during a day ,my older redmi Mobile was giving better SOT than this3)  network drops issue most often chrome shows blank page have to reload 3-4 times to show the page content4) the oxygen os is good smooth as silk5) camera performance is average6) amoled display surely surpasses lcd ,great colors diversification Conclusion- being new member to OnePlus community i expected premium services didn't expect such a buggy deviceUpdate- its been more than 2months of using it the problem has worsened the mobile heats like a heating rod even on a normal browsing for 10-15 minutes . Myb earlier mi mobile was better than it i do not have words to describe all the issue i am facing . Already shared the logs with oneplus team still no response . I will say only one thing if the return window wasnt. Closed i might have returned it . Its just a waste of money even a ki ,realme mobile at this price segment will be a great choice\\n\", '\\n  NO TINT ISSUEI TURNED ONT HE PHONE THEY GAVE ME AN UPDATE...SO typically your phone brightness level0 - 100 levelthey palyed it smart .. they removed 0--50 levelsSo technically when u slide to the left end on the brightness tab to reduce ur brightness thinking it would go to 0.. well it\\'s actually 50th level portraying as 0 ..

You are getting future ready with a 5g smartphone and Brand Recognition of One plus.Pros1) Oxygen OS2) 90Hz Amoled screen3) Smooth performance4) Good Battery Life5) Fast ChargingThere are not many cons according to me. The only one I which i noticed is that Rear camera quality isn't that great compared to Oneplus 8 like they are claiming. But they are good in Ample lighting conditions. Only when it comes to Indoor and low light they struggle a bit.Verdict- Go for it. It's a perfectely well balanced phone covering every aspects. The beauty of OXYGEN OS and Brand Recognition of ONE PLUS are something that you can't ignore.\\n\", \"\\n  Very worst phone don't buy.Iam facing network connection issues.while talking it is going into hold n recording starts automatically . whatsapp call not at all responding very very worst phone after few updates iam facing these problems ...one month after iam giving my feedback don't buy this phone waste of money ..\\n\", \"\\n  Let's start with the display of the phone one plus display is the better example in mid ranges phones range and camera is just as awesome as any other one plus phone and talk about gaming with the Nord was a good experience, though don’t mistake it for a gaming phone. Some 2D and lower-end 3D titles can easily hit the 90fps mark. You’d be happy playing 8 Ball Pool or Clash Royale on the Nord. However, heavier games such as Real Racing 3 and Fortnite do show some performance issues. Firstly, stutters are more frequent in high-action moments, such as gunfights in Fortnite. Secondly, frame rate drops occurred more often in games that rely on CPU-intensive features and if we talk about Battery of one plus so battery backup is never an issue with one plus because it comes with warp charger which takes your battery from 0 to 65 in just 30 minutes and lastly its price  I bought this awesome piece at 27999 from my icici amazon card by which I get 5% cashback... So if you want to buy one plus and your budget is lower than 30k then just go for it\\n\", '\\n  * Packing - Soft (Amazon)* Price - 25999 (AE Discount)* Touch - very smooth* Camera - front not good very disappointed by OnePlusBack - need improvement like filters and autofocus* Have some bugs* Purchase advise - Think again\\n', '\\n  1.

You may not notice it at first. But you'll see other phones in slow motion when you use other phones.2.The warp charging is amazing. Gets your phone filled in under an hour.3.The primary camera is nice and captures details but it lacks the natural colour reproduction at times and the dynamic range needs to be better.(the camera of the redmi k20 pro is slightly better in terms of the color reproduction) and iphone xr camera still is better4.The macro camera is bullshit and need updates right away.5. Wide angle lens is okay, just okay.needs betterment. And could be better.6.The selfie camera is fine but no iphone camera , the wide angle selfie isn't that nice7.the build quality is firm,nice and of nice built but stands a tad bit lower from the redmi k20 pro ,maybe because of the metal frame vs plastic in Nord.8.Fingerprint reader and face recognition is damn fast.9. The battery lasts for a day under moderate use. Not more than a day for sure.10.Oxygen OS ! Wow . Just smooth, fast and a bliss !\\n\", \"\\n  I had used my oneplus nord for 3hoursPros1.regarding display display was really cool with 90refresh rate and smooth2.

I am not satisfied with selfie cam in low light.The performance is average in heavy games but you won’t notice any problems in day to day tasks.The display is the best part about this phone the colours are punchy and gets plenty bright. The 90hz refresh rate with the180hz touch response is amazing and very smooth. The single speaker is loud but not as good as dual speakers. You will enjoy multimedia experience on this phone and the haptics are good too but feel a bit weak while typing. The battery is average too it lasted me a day with 7hrs of usage (without heavy games) but it gets covered up with the fast charging of 30 watts it only took 40 mins from 20% to 100.Overall I loved this phone but the selfie camera and macro camera needS improvements\\n', '\\n  Thank you OnePlus and Amazon... Product delivery is very fast.. I am first time using OnePlus device....but I love it...😘😘😘\\n', \"\\n  The phone has severe network issues and loses network very frequently. Call drops and Network unavailable most of the time. This is not an operator issue as I'm at home only in lockdown and get proper signal in other phones in the house.Secondly, even if you manage to get network, the phone has a very bad heating problem. Within 5-10 minutes of voice call the phone heats up badly and becomes unusable. You have to wait for it to cool before being able to use again.Lastly, the battery drain is too bad. Morning 8am at 100% gets to single digit by 5pm with average usage. If I try to watch videos/game then it goes down faster, but you don't have to worry about it as within 15 minutes of watching video/gaming the phone will heat up and give you a notification that some functions have been disabled to reduce temperature. So you don't worry about watching video or gaming for long.Overall too many bugs which are not resolved. Wouldn't recommend to anyone..\\n\", '\\n  what happened to oneplus. It used to be role model for quality in phones right from start with oneplus x. now we no longer can trust specs on paper.selfie camera is one of the worst ever. blurry pixelated images. 3 yrs old phone models in this range have better camera. even making calls have issues with this phone. there are bugs everywhere.very poor quality in ever aspect. total waste of money. they have to understand, they cant please everyone. End of the quality matters and there should be value for money spent and specs needs to be up to the industry standard. just saying 32 MP is not enough, if it performs equivalent to 5MP.this is my last oneplus and never again will trust this brand with my money.\\n', \"\\n  Just ok mobile there are lot more defects but manageable for normal users my suggestion to go with other brand's in this price# Black bar in night mode at top if display# Screen tint issue pucca# No Battery backup# Worst cam no use of back 2 cameras# No full screen mode for applications# No 3.5 Jack# Out of the box RAM 4gb/8gb# Sound us loud but no clear# Original accessories are so costly# More baground cached data# Sometimes lagging..Overall my rating is 4/10 please check all YouTube pros and cons before you buy don't buy in hurry like me.\\n\", \"\\n  Premium looking phone with a clean and smooth UI.

And the battery charges 15% to 100% in under an hour.Display- Very good resolution, the high refresh rate helps tooSmooth app handling and multitasking- even in my 8GB ram variantAudio - very nice driver range and playback quality (sounds perfectly good on good headphones and earphones)\\n', '\\n  After one day usage, I can say this is a very good mid range phone.Pros: smooth OS, Amoled screen quality is very good, no screen tint issues.No bloatware apps like other Chinese phones.Selfie camera is goodGood build quality.Face unlock is very fast.There are 6-10 tips and tricks available in Oxygen OS which is very useful in daily usage.Cons:Rear camera does decent job, not meeting the expectation set by OnePlus.Battery drains fast whenever refresh rate is set to 90Hz.On screen fingerprint scanner is not quick compared to rear scanner.Headphone jack is not a problem for me, I am using bluetooth earbuds. Also there are type c to 3.5mm converter available in the market in 200rupees.This Mobile is  very good choice for daily normal usage. Not recommended for heavy usage.\\n', \"\\n  I had the OnePlus 3T before I went for the Nord. I had bought the 3T for 35k and bought this 12gb variant for 30k and I have to say, it's a HUGE upgrade for me.People in the reviews keep on commenting about how the camera isn't good, while comparing it to phones outsidebita price range. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have to say, the cameras are excellent! The only phone that may be slightly better in the camera division maybe the Samsung A51 of a similar price range. But then again, the rest of the hardware in the A51 is pretty much garbage.The battery is excellent, touch response is excellent, gaming performance is good, not the best, but good enough (not for high perfomance gaming). I play COD on it on medium graphics and works very very smoothly. The display is just magnificent.If you are looking for a phone within 30k, your search stops here.\\n\", '\\n  I have been using this phone since 1 week now. And below are my findings.Pros:1. Oxygen OS experience. Its fluid and smooth. I already got 2 updates in one week.2. Excellent display.2. Camera. OIS and nightscape mode is too good. The depth and macro camera is of no use.3. Main selfie camera is good.4. Body design is good. Phone feels premium and easy to hold.5. Fast charging. It charges the phone from 0 to 100 in around 50 mins.6. Gaming is smooth without any lag. I played pubg, 8 ball pool and bully-anniversary edition.Cons: I thing the battery life is average. Maybe the 90hz screen is draining it quickly. I am getting 1 day of backup with moderate usage.All in all, I think this is a good purchase. There maybe other brands that are offering better on paper specs in this price but remember the main usp of this device is the experience of using oxygen operating system.\\n', \"\\n  I got the 12/256 version for 28k because of amex card. Best in this price I would say.Using this phone for more than 10 days now.Almost everything about this phone is best in this price.Processor: Works really well for day to day usage and any of the modern games. It won't lag or anything with 12gb ram.Display: you won't be disappointed at all. The best in this price. Nice amoled display, nice color and everything and 90Hz on top is like the best thing. Super smooth display.Camera: main rear camera is really good captures really good picture and low light photos r also good. Macro cam I don't think is that good, gets the job done. You can additionally use Gcam also if u want.But I Didn't like the selfie camera in low light, idk what the problem is but I guess with update they will fix it. Hopefully.Battery: Nice battery backup I would say. Gives about 7 hours of screen on time with moderate usage (including little gaming).And about charging speed, 0-100% in 55 minutes if you switch off and charge. And if it's on then it takes about 70 min to charge fully.Look and feel: Really looks good, I have the grey color which really suits. Premium glass back feels really light and premium.Speaker- no dual speaker or dolby atmos, but believe me the sound is really loud and clear. Actually better than other dual speaker phones.Cons- No 3.5mm audio jack and plastic frame.Conclusion- If u don't need the audio jack then I think this is the best buy in this price. You get brand value and oxygen OS with soo many other pros. Go with it without a second thought.Happy shopping 😊\\n\", \"\\n  Camera quality is very disappointing...even Samsung's below 20k models will take good photos. Don't get trapped by their hypes & Gimmicks...!!! Pls do watch Geekayranjith's Detailed review video before you order it. Worst thing is depth camera is fake,it's useless.

Nord is not as per expectations. Battery life is horrible. I need to charge my device twice a day. No doubt it gets only hour to charge but battery back up is 8-9 hour is hudge disappointing. Camera is not as per OnePlus know for. It is average like mid budget 15-20k device has. Micro camera is just to add numbers. Night mode is also not so great. It has Google dialpad. You can't auto record calls and even if you does after it keep alerting during call: you're call has been recorded.Only good thing is no ads. Oxygen OS.I'll never suggest to invest this much amount for average phone just because of brand name.\\n\", '\\n  The phone is good and definitely feels premium and in day to day life performance is as smooth as butter and camera is good, though can be improved with system updates and the warp charge is consistent and charges the phone from 0 to 100% in over an hour (depending on the voltage you receive ). Overall a pretty sweet phone with good built quality (It does not matter much that the frame is plastic afterall you are going to protect it with a case at the end of the day).Only thing that is lacking is the camera (a little bit) but that can be improved with updates.Otherwise I am satisfied with my purchase and it is a phone which is overall a very good device with good haptic feedback , topnotch indisplay fingerprint sensor etc. Talking about the tint issue , this can be solved with software update and hope that OnePlus would look into this issue and resolve it as soon as possible with a software update.\\n', \"\\n  This is one of the best phones from OnePlus buf with some fixable flaws. I'm using a 12GB RAM variant and not at all happy with the oxygen os's ram management. Even though my phone has 12gigs, it cannot keep more than 5 apps running in background and no app running in background after 15-20min, so just forget about heavy games which is not expected from OnePlus and that too from a 12gigs variant. I know keeping apps running in RAM could  drain the battery but let the users decide it :)Another thing is camera. Seriously macro lense sucks and is waste of space, waste of money, waste of time. Camera app needs a software update. Output images are not as great and consistent as from OnePlus 8 even though OnePlus's is claiming same module. Well mentioned issues can get solved in future updates. Display is awesome, but even my handset has that greenish shade issues when seeing  at screen in very dark room which isn't a big deal. If you're switching from a 800 series chip then you'll definitely see the performance difference but 90Hz covers it smartly. Everyone is saying battery is great but I didn't get more than 5hours of sot that too without gaming. Final call is yours, cheers!P.s. you can not uninstall the pre-installed Netflix app.\\n\", '\\n  Timely delivered. Overall satisfied with performance but camera is not upto the mark not a camera phone at all.\\n', \"\\n  Display quality is not as good, coming from the oneplus5, the amoled of Oneplus5 is far better.

Even making a basic phone call or receiving a phone call is nit error free! The basic utility of the phone itself has gone missing.The screen issue is existing, it's not noticeable in daily use. Only if you look for it you'll find it. Nevertheless, shouldn't be existing to an extent where normal usage is hindered by it. By far the worst iteration of phone by oneplus. Maybe the x was close to this in being bad.6 cameras, but not even one can produce decent results. They saybits the same module as OP8 but why is the result so bad from the main sensor? Looks like, they are wantedly degarding the performance to sell OP8 as well?90hz is present, but not certainly sure if it helps! As battery drains and have noticed couple if times, the phone phone hearts up! (After a week if usage, given that initial battery cycles might lead to extra heart dissipation) The peak brightness of my 5t is higher than Nord!All in all, look somewhere else. Not the right time to buy, maybe few issues might be fixed with OTA software updates. But there many hardware issues on this like the screen, battery and maybe the calling network issues!So, for time being stay away! Will update the review in future is OTA updates solve them!\\n\", '\\n  Surely the hype was worth it and so was the wait!!Pros- Display, Performance, In-display fingerprint, Premium feelCons- Mono speaker, Not so effective macro cameraBut ignore the cons and just get the device as no other mobile can compete with 12/256GB model in this range.\\n', \"\\n  Positive:1.

Haptic feedback motor is just OkayNegative:1. Below standard camera performance at low-light, selfie camera is not that sharp or good. Slow image processing noticed. Software optimization required. OnePlus could provide a telephoto lense instead of giving those bad depth and macro lenses2. 90hz display is not as smooth as I expected. Software optimization is required3. Auto brightness could have been work more smoothly, Jarking noticed when the brightness is getting increase or decrease. Again the software optimization required.4. 3.5 mm jack is not there. At least the type C converter must be included in the box5. Sometime noticed the screen gets tapped when the fingers are extremely close to the screen.Verdict:1. Good for a reliable daily driver but probably the gaming experience will not be immersive2. 5G has no use. The device could be configured with SD 730G chipset since the performance is pretty much similar to the 730G based devices. Price could be reduced atleast upto 5K by Using the 730G processor3. Balanced device. This device has no extraordinary feature and has nothing extemely bad4. 12GB variant is the best value for money option5. Over hyped and little over priced. Only go for it if you like OnePlus and it's clean UI\\n\", \"\\n  Though it has a screen issue in low brightness but overall good device.In low light if the screen brightness is set in low then there is a black bar through the camera cutout and also has slightly greenish tint.But in regular usage it doesn't make any effect.Overall good battery in regular usage and performance is also good enough.Thanks to oxygen .....is for smooth experience.NB. Cameras need more optimization and solve the screen issue. Though it has 90 hz refresh rate but some times it lags. Need to fix this minor problems.\\n\", '\\n  Oneplus Nord...

Is kind of decent and I won\\'t say it\\'s a great one I have been playing heavy games recently and I get roughly about 30 percent remaining battery life at the end of the day... So it\\'s pretty decent.3. Camera, here it\\'s the main feature where you can take great photos at the outer lighting conditions and in indoor it also take some pretty good photos not bad.. The macro camera the only disappointing factor other than that this one is great for taking good shots. And the front camera is great and the wide angle lens makes the best use from it. Video quality is great in both the front and back camera thanks to the optical image stabilization.4. Performance... The snapdragon 765G doing a decent job as it shows no lag in the loading of apps don\\'t worry about the PUBG high graphic settings it really works great super smooth in its at most usable higher setting. If you are a heavy gamer then you should go for other Snapdragon processor which gives high graphic importance in the play.5. Display... The 6.44 inch super Amoled display looks good and yes in the outdoor just make sure you increase the brightness before you go out or else you can\\'t what\\'s in the screen. Since it\\'s 6.44 pill shape punch hole design the phone doesn\\'t look soo big and it\\'s handy to use. Even in the 60 htz display it works soo smooth thanks to the Oxygen OS and in 90 htz it\\'s even more smoother for browsing and scrolling news feeds in social media but it takes 2% of charge higher than usual.6. Fast charging... From 20 to 100 percent it takes around 1 hour to charge and its good job for its battery capacity.7. No headphone jack... It\\'s the major disappointment in this phone but yeah you can use a type c to 3.5 audio jack dongle which cost you extra.And finally from the attached picture you can see in my phone there is \"no green tint\" issue in the oneplus nord, maybe some units got that issue and I hope they have replaced them... Overall Nord is a good phone from oneplus don\\'t think about other negative points people tell if you are planning to buy just go for it. My 4 star for this phone is just because of the delivery delay for my pre booking and the worst packing... It got so many damages in my box. Thanks hope you guys find this review useful.\\n', '\\n  Pathetic product from oneplus , and more to add in bad experience  there pathetic customer supportBrought it and within a week it shows *Qualcomm crashdump mode*Customer supports answers after 20,30 mins and asks for problem and then put on hold for another 30 minsNo where to report issue and ask for helpInstead I would have bought 9k mobile ,that works at least for year with decent  customer  service\\n', '\\n  Beware !!Oneplus nord has serious network issues.Dual VOLTE is not always working. I am not able to recieve calls. I tried with Jio sim on both slots. Even tried using idea sim on one slot with 2g network. Tried different combinations; changing primary and secondary sim\\'s. Ultimately found that there is a serious network bug in the software (or hardware?) and to solve this temporarily, i am now switching on/off airplane mode every now an then. Annoying!!!

Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.\\n', '\\n  Defective product received, it gets 8 to 12 hours in charging and Amazon is not exchanging the product\\n', \"\\n  Very poor performance.

Due to this pandemic situation and blaming china for this corona virus I have decided to purchase a korian company phone . But I broke up my trust . Battery life is poor as it's shows 6000Mah but performance wise it's behave like 4000Mah. Bcuz it's drain so quickly processor is very slow it's hang up in 5 minute and heat like u can make your veggie on this even it's can burn ur ears finger print is not responding I have washed my hand many time but it's not ready to recognize it's. Finally my humble request to amazon pls return this I have made a big mistake to purchase it. Pls help me to return it\\n\", \"\\n  A nice looking phone.Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.\\n\", \"\\n  Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.\\n\", \"\\n  Don't like this product. It looks, it's already used by someone else. Apps are not downloading. It shows 6 appsare downloading. I'm confused.\\n\", \"\\n  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀\\n\", \"\\n  Amazon delivered a defective phone to me and then they don't even receive my call while I tried to approach them.  Buying Samsung Galaxy M21 is waste of money.\\n\", '\\n  I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k\\n', '\\n  1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.It’s better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.\\n', \"\\n  I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours.\\n\", '\\n  Samsung m21 Mobile not in the delivery box, only charger and pin are available. Need refund for the same.For mobiles, its better to opt for cash on delivery, to avoid getting cheated.\\n', '\\n  Display good, battery  performance  after one  week  of use has improved,camera is good,hope Samsung  provides  regular  updates..Excellent  phone  keep good  work  up Samsung 👌\\n', '\\n  Realy very very good phone,but stil I did not get,due to covid\\n', \"\\n  There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.\\n\", '\\n  Battery  drain quickly... and phone heat a lot.\\n', '\\n  I got phone having mic issue and there is no option to put a replacement request as i tried download the blanco app that doesnt work and just hanged in between and no technical person available to check whenever i called..so how would i place the request to replacement??\\n', \"\\n  What can I say just after 30 min.of recieving this phone I applied for return my money.

Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc\\n', '\\n  Good product\\n', \"\\n  The phone is simply amazing. The Raven Black model looks gorgeous. Very sturdy. The camera quality is excellent. The UI is user friendly. This phone is similar to the Samsung range of phones, so it is hard to decide the model that's best for its price.

For folks who like a premium looking phone not the fancy looking phone, this is the best at this price segment. all other products at this price bracket consist of fancy and decorated back which may not be the cup of tea for a section of people for whom simple and plain is the premium. Monster battery, One of the best display at this price segment, great finger print sensor, decent camera etc..

Still this phone manages to freeze even with just one app running it can be just the chrome browser. Here is summary of what i observed  - Samsung one ui comes with lot of annoying advertisement and notifications, i suspect these galaxy app hog cpu in the background  - Privacy is a huge concern specially with discover feature  - For those who are accustomed to having google news feed by swiping right on home screen, you will find it missing in this phone  - Phone freezes a lot, typical workaround for me is to lock it and wait for a minute unlock and it works  - Wide angle camera shots are really good  - camera quality is nice as well  - battery life is  great, i am charging every two days instead of daily night  - look and finish a not extra-ordinary but are not bad as well  - Does not allow you to restore from google backup on start which is a headache on setting it up, it does come with samsung switch app but that would just install app and cannot restore login and data like google restoreverdict=====Buy this if you are ok with advertisements (i guess same is true with mi, realme etc) from samsung, not too much into heavy usage like gaming etc.Edit 1====phone freeze issue reduced by a lot by removing external sd card. Browser does freeze sometimes but the frequency is a lot lessSamung ui misses user friendly sms/call blocking, you have to select individual message sender details and then block which is a headache and can be improved\\n\", '\\n  Just after starting the phone I am facing the heating problem .

I further thought to convince my friends & relatives to use Samsung gadgets instead of Xiaomi. But after purchasing Samsung Galaxy M21 from Amazon which was delivered on 30-05-2020, my whole enthusiasm went in trash and I am helpless to compare it with my last handset Redmi 8 which was valued just Rs. 7,999/- as compared to Rs. 12,699/- of Samsung Galaxy M21. I don’t want to compare Samsung with Xiaomi handsets, but now realize how Xiaomi has captured Indian market in short span of time, surely because of quality & performance of their gadgets.I am trying Amazon customer care since 01-06-2020, but unable to connect and no response from their side. Below are serious issues found in just 2-3 days of using Samsung Galaxy M21 :• While using wi-fi calling feature, outgoing calls & receiving of SMS gets completely barred• While using wi-fi, HD call gets stopped• Whole battery gets drain in just 6-7 hours, not upto 6000 mAh handset performance.• Fingerprint sensor is very weak, it takes 3-4 times for login• Dual apps feature is limited for few applications only• Voice recording feature needs improvementPlease support in getting this issue resolved at the earliest.\\n', '\\n  Everything about this phone is great...best phone and best brand 💪💪.Loved it and nowi am enjoying it 😍😍\\U0001f929\\U0001f929\\U0001f970\\U0001f970😇😇\\n', '\\n  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch \"hater\" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi\\'s. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!\\n', \"\\n  Believe me...the best smartphone you can buy at this price range if you are not a hardcore gammer...don't compare it with cheap Chinese products.\\n\", \"\\n  When the phone arrived 1st 2days are quite good and phone worked perfectly.  But after 2days it started showing sone battery problems and battery lasts only upto 3 to 4 hrs which not accepted with this phone and it's getting even worse now. And now Amazon is not responding to it . It seems like i lost my 13 thousand money.  If any help provided it means alot to me coz i didn't expected this kind of trust issue with amazon.\\n\", '\\n  Battery charging takes too much time and when opted for replace, so much of formalities by amazon. Highly disappointed of purchasing such a valuable item from Amazon. Only by technician check, and after his report, amazon decides whether the item should be replaced or not. No value for customer words. Very bad experience with amazon purchase.\\n', \"\\n  Samsung galaxy m21 (I'm having 4gb ram variant) is a excellent phone in this price segment.Pros:1. Best display under 20k2. Great audio quality via headphones jack (supports dolby audio which is obviously a gimmick but this phone has high res support hence if you have Poweramp you would get maximum quality performance from it.) and has a loud output from loud speaker.3. Excellent battery life (for heavy use easily getting SOT more than 8 hours)4. Great for watching movies supports for FHD+ playback in ott.5. Good performance, not stutters or lag I have noticed (I usually dont keep more than 3 apps in background when in not use).6. Games don't lag or have frame drops if I have moderate graphics. (Even pubg runs great in smooth and extreme settings).7. Samsung One UI is the best next to stock Android (Oxygen os, stock android no big difference except few additional features in Oxygen os). Also comes with Android 10 out of the box.8. Decent camera quality both front and back.9. Unlike previous m series phones this one comes with Corning Gorilla glass 3 and I haven't applied any screen protection and have no scratches till now🤞🤞🤞10. Multitasking is the best feature in this phone. Pop up view mode is a excellent festures. Helps to play games listening to music in youtube or other apps, text messages, browse web simultaneously with this large display.Cons :1. Plastic back can easily get scratched can be avoided using a case.2. Could have added 18W fast charging capabilities takes 2-2.5hours to fully charge (from 15 or 20% to 100).3. Not for gamers who expect high graphics. But recommend for casual gamers or gamers who would be okay to play in moderate graphics.4. Worst camera quality in night mode. Night mode photos are totally unusable. (Samsung may fix this issue with software update if they work on this issue)Conclusion:Don't know why many are complaining about poor battery life or heating issue or games totally unplayable complaints. Dont spread false informations.I haven't faced these issue, even in heavy useage.Buy this phone if you want a all-rounder phone which ticks every boxes.Fyi,Like all other phones in this price segment, even Samsung pushes ads, but here during initial setup of the phone it ask if we would opt for recommendations. If we opt out we wont get any ads and recommendations.👍👍👍\\n\", \"\\n  This is my second review.  This is after a week's use. So far I have found that phone is good.

The seller just delivered a used product with loads of defects. The camera was not functioning, the torch was not functioning and there could be more defects. I was just checking the item the moment it was delivered and encountered with these two defects. Upon unboxing, I found that the phone had a tempered glass already fitted to it. Initially I overlooked this but later realized that someone who had purchased it invested on the glass (and may have used it for a couple of days) with the defects before finally rejecting it. I think the M21 product should be fine and it is upon the seller who tried to strike a deal in such troubled times.

Which I need to highlight is this phone have serious network issue I have also shown this issue to my nearest Samsung Service Centre they even can't help me so if you guys have a very  bad network or average Network at your home or your workplace so this phone is not for you..\\n\", '\\n  galaxy m21 review:-first of all, it\\'s a very similar device to the galaxy m30s galaxy a50s and galaxy a51 in terms of internal you can\\'t tell the difference between galaxy m30s and m21 in just looking at it. there are some differences between the two devices but not a lot.good:-Display:- so this is the main feature of this phone a full HD super AMOLED display on a 14000 rupees phone is very rear and this the differentiating feature of this device, which include lots of feature of own it\\'s own such as always on true notch hiding and some battery-saving features so it doesn\\'t have the on-screen fingerprint sensor which frankly speaking a good thing because Samsung\\'s in-screen fingerprint sensor is bad really bad it\\'s that bad you  prefer not to use it, and it\\'s fingerprint also have swipe gestures for the notifications which work all the time unlike it\\'s the in-display fingerprint sensor.Software:- software is also really good and it has some neat feature too like the system-wide dark mode which saves battery on the AMOLED screen\\'s and clean and well thought out layout for the one-handed use a good if not great out of the box launcher with few customizations, unlike some Chinese OEM\\'s software, hex installer, and the good lock is absent which is a big bummer for the customization freaks and overall it\\'s nicer UI than most of the Chinese ones and one thing more it also supports android 10\\'s stock navigation gestures which are a heck of a lot better than MIUI\\'s.battery:- it\\'s a full day battery comfortably with all the necessary sensors on the auto-brightness and vibration both of which disabled out of the box for some reason \"because Samsung thinks we are a fool\" it\\'s a 6000 MAH battery if this type capacity would provide another phone my be it was juice it out little longer than this phone does.camera :- this is very strange camera in default camera app shoots very saturated photo and the video is good honestly quite good for the price in day light in nights this phone just falls apart very easily, and wide angle camera is fixed focus which is a good thing or bad thing I don\\'t know, I use it very occasionally and I I am surprised to see that AR doodle and AR emoji is present In it\\'s camera app which is nice bonus.Bad or desired thingBuilt quality:- it\\'s a have a plastic back with a plastic frame means it\\'s a plastic phone and have plastic\\'s quirks like despite having a 6000 mAh battery, it feels light, relatively thin and more ergonomic, it\\'s a plastic, plastic materials are more prone to be scratched but it more durable than glass, if tap on the back around the camera it creates hollow sound so built quality is not on par with the competition.performance: - performance leaves a bit desired because it handles everyday stuff like WhatsApp Instagram and other productivity Apps quite smoothly and in games, it\\'s fall flat in front of the competition and in the 4gb variant 2GB of memory is occupied by the system already so ram Management is an issue in this device, and the stupid battery optimization is killing all the third-party apps in the background some of the like the music app suddenly stops playing song after 1 hrs, you have to disable the battery optimization from the setting in each app you use in the background all the time.Bloat & Ads:- it has all the Microsoft suits preloaded and be careful when you set up the device at the start don\\'t select the option ad recommendation option. even after that my galaxy apps constantly send the spammy notification.so it worth 14000? In my use case yes! I am not a heavy user I don\\'t play heavy games on my phone, for the heavy users, there are lots of better offerings on the online market!\\n', '\\n  Camera quality not that much what we expect rear and selfy both camera -pic quality missed , battery life max 18hours if we used data , This report as of after 3days usage\\n', \"\\n  No doubt i am loving Samsung m 21 4/64, which i ordered on 25th may, got delivered on 27th may. One thing to consider, this smartphone excels in display, camera quality and battery life...Processor is not that  powerful or not even close to sd 675 in terms of gaming. I have to use gfx tool, lowering resolution( less than hd) and other graphics stuff to Low with fps set to ultra(40fps). By applying this gfx tools settings i can play Pubg hell lot better with stable 30-40 fps. Dont try extreme,fps will be very unstable. With stock Pubg settings i am facing tremendous lags, stutters and fps drops even in the lobby, Cant say about 6/128 gb model. Didn't try Cod, i usually dont play, Pubg lite plays fine with smooth extreme option only. My verdict if u are not too much into gaming, Play clash of clans, or can adjust to above settings of Pubg, Go ahead to buy,  If pubg is top priority go with Vivo U20/Realme 6/Redmi note 9.\\n\", '\\n  Review for 6GB/128GB varient (Review after one month use)Pros: Really a amazing phone in peformance wise. smooth like iphone. Battery last for three days even with wifi and bluetoooth connected for almost 10 hours a day. High end games are running without lag. Dual speakers so music plays loud. No heating issue as of now. Depth camera is really cute, you must experience it to believe. Corrila glass doing its part perfectly. No scraches even after rough one month usage. Screen resolution in amazing; Super Amoled is really superb. Finger print senson is fast (even less than a second)Cons: Apart from depth camera all other cameras are not upto the mark. But its ok for unprofessional use. Not recommended for selife freakouts. Phone is little heavey due to 6000 MAH.\\n', '\\n  For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.Samsung Galaxy M21: Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display.A few months back, Samsung successfully made big-battery smartphones accessible with its M-series. But the mid-range is a tough segment to crack with the competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Realme. But Samsung knows how critical this segment is right now, given the current situation where consumers are more price-sensitive than ever. For these uncertain times, the new Galaxy M21 makes a lot of sense. Here’s a closer look at what it’s been like to use the Galaxy M21 over the past week.Samsung Galaxy M21 specifications: 6.4-inch FHD+ SAMOLED display|Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM or 64GB/128GB storage|48MP main camera+5MP depth and 8MP ultra wide angle|6000mAh batery|20MP front camera|188grams, 8.9mm thick|Android 10, OneUI 2.0Samsung doesn’t try to be different with the Galaxy M21, and that’s just fine. Let me be clear: I don’t have too many things to say about the Galaxy M21 because the phone looks exactly like the Galaxy M31. So, the Galaxy M21 has a polycarbonate back like the Galaxy M31. Some people may not find it interesting but it never felt like using a cheap plastic phone.For a phone with a 6000mAh battery, the design and build seem perfect. I also liked the fact that the phone doesn’t feel heavy or bulky, considering the massive battery inside the device. However, I do feel the Galaxy M-series phones have become a bit too dull in terms of design. To be frank, none of this matters to a user who is coming from the Galaxy J-series or any older generation Samsung phone.Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display. The 6,000mAh battery in the Galaxy M21 goes on and on. It managed to last one and a half days with my standard usage pattern, which includes browsing the web, listening to Spotify, emails, checking Facebook and Twitter, and light gaming. Since the phone’s battery lasts for so long, you don’t want to worry about taking the charger with you. A quick-charge with the charger fills the phone’s battery in minutes.Another aspect of the M21 that I liked the most is the display. This is a big phone with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display. And since the phone uses an AMOLED display, the contrast level is great and the black levels are absolute. Even though a lot of mid-range phones these days offer AMOLED displays, the ones made by Samsung have better displays somehow. I found the screen absolutely fine for reading eBooks, watching YouTube, and web browsing. By the way, the small U-shaped notch doesn’t annoy me anymore. It did annoy me a lot at the beginning but it soon becomes a part of the scenery.Speaking of performance, the Galaxy M21 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M31. Samsung has used this processor on many of its mid-range phones and going by my testing, the chipset gets the job done. I was able to open all of the popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok on the device without any issues. But don’t try to run too many heavy games that could slow down the performance. The phone runs on Android 10, and Samsung has done a good job with OneUI 2.0. My review unit had 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage.You won’t get a great camera system, and that’s one area where I think the phone falls flat. You get a 48MP primary camera sensor alongside an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP depth camera. The 48MP main sensor is a hit and miss. Sometimes the photos look great and other times the photos come out of focus. That’s not to say the camera is bad, it is just not consistent. The Galaxy M21 takes bright shots but in some cases, images lack richness. Even though the phone lets you take ultra-wide angle shots or bokeh shots I wasn’t too impressed. In comparison to the Galaxy M31, the Galaxy M21 pales in the camera department. For a change, though, the Galaxy M21’s 20MP front-camera surprisingly worked well both indoors and outdoors.The Galaxy M21 performs similarly to the Galaxy M31. I mean, both phones have a 6000mAh battery, identical processors and displays, and even the design is the same. What the Galaxy M21 noticeably lacks, however, is a camera that’s not at par to the Galaxy M31. Still, there’s a lot to love about the Galaxy M21. For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.\\n', \"\\n  I order this mobile from amazon..first 1month experience is great..good quality camera,best battery,average fingerprint..but after 1 month the mobile give charging problem...mobile can't charge..when i call for help amazon says that go to samsung care ..no one can help when the product is damage...just harrssing us... don't buy from amazon..\\n\", '\\n  No wonder why Samsung is the most used & most loved smartphone brand in the world! This is my first Samsung phone and I exchanged my previous damaged phone online for 2k.After spending one whole month in researching the best phone under 15k, I finally got it figured out and chose Galaxy M21. And Youtube videos and comments helped me take the wise choice. I got the deal (4gb 64gb) at Rs.13,500 and got it delivered in 6 days.Plenty of reasons why I chose M21:Will to honour our country heroesMonster BatteryGreat Display (feels like you are also present in the movie)Trust in Samsung Brand NameBetter CameraLesser weight (a boon for long time gamers)Polycarbonate back (safe against drops)Premium look rather than Fancy Nancy cheap plastic bodyType C ChargerThe Processor Debate:To those who wonder the same as I did (If we can play Pubg smoothly),The honest answer is YES. Pls do not take third opinions who claim that Exynos processor is lame (which is a false claim of knowledge). I can\\'t say if it is bad or awesome, but it is definitely Decent! You can play Smooth+Extreme or Balanced+Ultra without any issue. Even if you do full and heavy usage for 12 hours continiously, battery is sufficient and fast charging works too. So i easily charge every night before going to sleep and turn it off in middle of night.Super Tips for Common Problems in All PhonesUpdate OS to avoid heating & restart issue (which happens not only in M21 but even in 60k phonesNever use a phone cleaner or battery saver app. Use the inbuilt power saving option.Turn off Bluetooth, Location, etc when not neededDon\\'t charge even after reaching 100%Close apps when not needed, especially close all when playing game (and also enable gaming mode)Uninstall least used appsWhoever reads this comment can trust me and click the Amazon \"Buy Now\" button without any fear because this is the ONE perfect-ish smartphone under 15k category.Friends.... this phone feels like you hold jewel in your hand .\\n', '\\n  \\xa0So of course battery and display is awesome.The charger is not soo fast but its okay, decent performance ,but i am very dissappointed with  its camera its not upto the mark (48megapixel) photo quality achhi nhi lgi, it doesnt capture the details  not even is this good for night or low light photography and in video its focus is worst\\n', '\\n  Super colour blue\\n', '\\n  \\xa0After reading a lot of reviews regarding network issues of the M31 and M21 I was a bit skeptical to buy the M21. I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception. After using the Honor 6x and Honor Play I was thinking of buying the Honor 9x pro but after I found out that it did not support Google Play I opted out. So then I began researching other brands and I came across the Galaxy M21. The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back. By chance I happened to come across a video in YouTube regarding LTE / 3g / 2g settings in the M21. Bingo! I knew where the problem was. So without waiting any longer I ordered this smartphone.After receiving it and using it for a few days I am glad my decision was correct. In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default. I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G. Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G. So if I select the LTE only option the phone will latch on to the 4G signal even if it becomes a little weak.So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone. I hope this helps.\\n', \"\\n  Just one word. It's best. Purchased it in 15 may 2020 at 12,999 till now phone's performance is superb.

Heavy to hold and inconvenient to handle. Worst part is  Amazon doesn't have a return policy and suggested me to do a exchange instead with another brand of my choice (with heavy deduction of course). Amazon accept a return for the mobile case though and processed for refund, the mobile is lying with me and wondering what to do with it.  Am just not too happy with my choice of purchase on Amazon.

This is not a war, lesson for China :)I have pledge to boycott all China products!Here is the review:Good phone with long battery life, the feeling of touch is amazing. Value for money.\\n', '\\n  The product is wast never buy M21this moblie it is wast of money.The moblie get hanged offen. I got first samsung  moblie this was my first non Chinese  moblie and i am quite  upset with this performance. Hence do not buy M21 ..4gb atleast. Even you tube vedio get stuck offen. I guess  this mobile phone  has Week  processor. It takes lot of time to open the gGoogle Chrome  with jio fiber net. And even with idea  net work aswell. So pls do not buy M21.i feel cheated.  Lot of problems  with the phone. Worst mobile i have ever got in my life.\\n', '\\n  the battery is too good and pubg works fine too.i reccomend not going for brands like mi realme and other chinese brandsbloatware free (adfree) one ui is even better than stock android. camera is fine too.Another thing is that dont go for the realme 6 or 6 pro for its 90 hz display because its ips lcd.amoled 60 hz is way better than that.\\n', \"\\n  Here is my review on the new samsung m21.I'm using this smartphone from 2 months so I can give my comment to help you guys make up your decision. I categorise my review based on the following points: (a) Built Quality (b) Display (c) Camera (d) Performance (e) Software (f) Battery(A) Build quality: It's a nice looking phone with a standard build quality nothing fancy on the back. Plain standardised back side with glossy finish but very well built keeping in mind it has 6000 mah battery. It's feels quite light in hands. It's a sturdy phone and it can handle if it accidentally it drops sometime. If you want to get fully packed phone in this price range it's a good phone to buy with this build quality.(B) Display: We all know samsung make great displays so here also it's a 6.4 inch water drop notch mailed display which is amazing in this price range. I bought this phone only for its great display and cameras. I mostly watch videos on my phone and it's a great experience. Even the touch response is also very good in samsung phones. Amoled display and 6000 mah battery is a great combination.(C) Camera: Camera is it's highlight in this price range. Samsung captures very good photos with a good balance of colors and natural sharp photos. The colors in photos are not over saturated. It takes very good photos. M21 has 20 mp front cam and 48 mp back camera which takes amazing photos. Samsung live focus provide some amazing features. Samsung UI is brilliant providing u some amazing features in camera.(D) Performance: Samsung's performance is quite balanced with exynos 9611 series processor. I don't do much gaming but for occasional gaming it will not disappoint you but specifically for gaming you can check out some other products with better processors in this price range. But for day to day usage it performs good and samsung hi provides great performance with this processor. So you are getting a good camera bigger battery and sufficient powerful processor.(E) Software: Samsung UI is great no ads altogether and has great features which are really useful. You can check some videos on features for samsung UI. I like the Samsung standardised UI which is great easy to use and smooth.(F) Battery: For battery it's a 6000 mah battery so you can expect a 2 days battery life for normal user and 1 day full use for heavy users who do a lot of gaming movie and videos watching. But for battery you can give 7 star and samsung did a great work by keeping the phone light weigh also with this massive battery inbuilt. So it's a great phone in this price range. Fully packed samsung phone.\\n\", '\\n  Phone is very good. But charger is not up to the mark. It takes 2.5 hours toh charge from 1%  to 100%. So plz change this charger. Although performance wise ph is superb. In 15000 rs range . Ultimate ph\\n', \"\\n  First time buying a Samsung phone and absolutely loved the experience.......the phone is 9/10 overall...The feel in the hand is really premium even with polycarbonate back...I've held glass phone and this phone doesn't feel any cheaper....Samsung didn't make any compromises with phone ...my only complain is the fingerprint scanner it takes a little swipe to unlock rather than a tap...I'm not quite used to this.....the performance in public is great too.  ...I reccomend gfx tool to achieve true 60 fps possible to GPU optimization in premium gfx tool ......the best thing about this phone is the battery ....... it's a beast and nothing can beat it in this price range....I get minimum of 8hrs of screen time in my heavy usage with the phone playing games and using social media apps.....its my new favourite phone...thx to samsung\\n\", '\\n  Your representative visited at my home in connection with complaint regarding fault in my phone.  But till now no reply or action has been initiated to redress my complaint.  Please do the needful at the earliest as my business is adversely affected due to faulty mobile phone.  After this request if no relief is provided to me I would have  only option of legal action in term of newly introduced consumer protection act.\\n', \"\\n  I have never been a fan of customized Android phones, and have mostly preferred phones with the stock Android. I was looking to a new phone because the manufacturer of my earlier phone did not support security updates that were required for my work apps / email.This is my second Samsung phone, after the 2010-launched Nexus S. Compared to earlier phones, this feels a little big and is heavier as well. Perhaps it could be due to the battery. So far, there is nothing to complain about, but I would have liked the price to be comparable to the Redmi models. I got this one for ~ Rs. 14K, which the seller claims is at a Rs. 2K discount. I wouldn't have bothered to pay Rs. 16K for sure. The Redmi Note 9 comes in at around Rs. 12K for similar configuration. I would have bought the Redmi phone, but the reviews made me feel suspicious about it (especially about the ads being displayed).Some stand out points:§ Made in India: I didn't have a constraint on this one, but hey, if it's made in India, then, why not.§ Selfie camera: Samsung says it us 20 MP. It is definitely better than other models I have been using. (Note: I almost always prefer phones below Rs. 15K)§ Android 10: This itself was my constraint. I was looking only for Android 10 phones. One of the most important things for me was the support for dark mode.§ Reputed manufacturer: Well, Samsung is the leader. So, can't go much wrong with this brand.§  Minor irritants:§§ The setup process feels as though using the Samsung's Smart Switch app is the only way to get data from your existing phone. If you do not want to use it, the setup wizard is slightly different than the stock Android version. If you have a backup of the previous Android phone on Google, that can be used as well. However, setup takes a long time as compared to the stock Android version.§§ The location of the back and recent app buttons on the navigation bar are swapped. I had to install a button remapper app to swap the 2 buttons.§§ Samsung tries to push its own apps and its account sign up. I avoided it like plague, and deleted all the unnecessary apps.§§ I prefer the Nova launcher app. I feel at home after installing this app.In short, after some customization, it was back to what I wanted.\\n\", '\\n  I was looking for a smartphone with good battery life for using it as hotspot, all other features were secondary for me. I am satisfied with the needs but I have to mention below thingsPros:Battery is good as per 5 days of usage with 30 + default google appsScreen is bright and very good to look atno lag for normal apps (im not a game fan) ConsWorst ever camera i used on a smartphone. 48MP is just the size of image, quality of what it captures is patchy and bad images. Camera quality compared to the advertisement is very bad.Heating issue when screen is on while charging.\\n', '\\n  First when I got this phone I found it has issues with mic. Hence I placed a request for replacing the item. Second time also I faced the same issue. When I am the caller, the receiver is able to hear my voice clearly. But when I am the receiver, caller is not able to hear me properly. I need to talk louder in order to be audible. I returned the phone again. I would want Samsung to check this issue and work on it. Otherwise all the other features in this phone are value for money.\\n', \"\\n  Perfect mobile phone with more storage space, Excellent sound quality with Dolby atmos ,extended battery life ..I tried to use full night to watch OTT web series.. morning 42% of battery life is pending.. if you keep volume less than 50% we can't hear any sound ..company should improve this .. we can't keep volume with 100% at all time... Inbuilt functionality of install 2 social apps like WhatsApp ,FB etc., my suggestion .. if you are looking for phone less 15000 with so many features. This is one of the best model to look:)\\n\", '\\n  I got the delivery yesterday. My last phone was Poco F1. M21 is a good phone at this price point. as its a big battery with 15W charging capacity it will take anywhere between 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge but once charged it can easily go for 2 days for non-gamer. Camera is good at this price point.The best thing is its Samsung, which has good after service and if you take samsung care + home pickup and drop. for M21 2 years the price of care+ is Rs1349 with everything covered except theft\\n', '\\n  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a month. The box comes with M21 handset, Power adapter, USB cable and ejection pin. Earphones are not included in it. The battery performance is quite good, it takes not more than 2 hrs to charge completely from zero to 100% and on medium usage, can last upto 2 days. The phone handset is very light weight as compared to M10, M20 which is very heavy to carry because of heavy weight of battery. One good thing is that the M21 handset as well charger or power adapter is made in India. As of now, the overall performance is good, battery output is efficient though there is some heating of device during charging, only sometimes & not always. Camera quality is good too but in natural light settings. I need to use this phone for some more time to further write detailed updated review but at the end of the day, Samsung can be trusted for their phones.\\n', '\\n  Biometrics is good i.e. fingerprint sensor and face recognition works very smooth. Phone performance is smooth , do not lag.But :-1. 6000mAh do not run for more than 24 hours in normal usage, no games, no music, song, just net crowsing over wifi.2. Camera is 48 MP but the sensors behind it make that 48mp pretty useless, the moment you zoom post taking 48mp photo (3:4) you will find out that it is not 48 mp, as pixel started splitting.3. Personally I did not like UI, so switched to Microsoft UI and that works smooth.\\n', '\\n  The seems ok. Plastic built phone. Camera is ok. Charger and cable seems poor in quality. the packaging was so poor. thank god that the product reached home safely. only a plastic cover as available. company not including any earphone, back cover or screen guard, nothingis present. its my first with with the phone.\\n', '\\n  Amazon deserves the innumerable accolades for delivering this phone in this maze of lockdown.  This is ineffable service from Amazon. This is great and uncomparable phone. THANK YOU SAMSUNG..outstanding performance and extraordinary battery life..\\n', \"\\n  The phone doesn't even turned on and It's not getting charged also. Unfortunately there is no return or refund policy for this. If you want to return this item you have to install one smartchek app and diagnose the issue, otherwise Amazon will arrange an inspection service at your delivery address and you'll get a replacement only if the technician is convinced. Amazon is simply cheating it's customers. Never expected this kind of discourteous service from Amazon.\\n\", '\\n  Batterry is verry verry very poor\\n', '\\n  Previous generations of Samsung phones used to provide better quality though. This one provides excellent specs for the price, but doesn\\'t come with earphones and its charging cable is very short. I have to use a USB extension cable to make up for that. Operation is real smooth and lots of space. Camera is okay, battery is great but that\\'s the \"standard\" in the age of Mi. Fingerprint reader frequently fails. Lots of features I enjoyed in the older Galaxy J7-6 are missing though. Thankfully almost all my customizations are preserved thanks to Smart Switch. Still for a Samsung phone it has too much bloatware. Thankfully I am able to disable all of them. Guess that\\'s why the low price, I\\'m content with it, with this RAM, storage and battery it\\'ll make overall usage comfortable.\\n', \"\\n  Review after 10 days..1.battery life is awesome.5/52.charging time is 2.30hrs from 0 to 100%.4.5/53.camera quality is nice. 4.5/54. processors is good for multi tasking but not for hard core gaming however causual games work fine 4.5/5.5.no network/call/data issues. 5/5display is awesome.5/5 no doubt.6.fingerprint sensor slowed down after 10 days 3/5.Overall al best budget phone but the delivery experience was horrible the delivery person was very rude to behave and even refused to come at the parking of the building...i could have rated 1 star but i don't want to spoilnthe reputation of the such big  company like SamsungYOU CAN ALSO SEE THE QUALITY OF INVOICE RECEIVED.....😡😡\\n\", \"\\n  The phone really is monstrous.This is my honest review after 20 days usage.PROS:Battery LifeSAMOLED DisplayCamera QualityOne UILooks for the price paid.Ease of UsageBudget FriendlyDolby Atmos SupportCONS:Pathetic 4G Network ReceptionShort WiFi ReceptionSlow Charging - 2.5hrs Full ChargeHope the network reception issues can be resolved via Software Update.In general I'm so happy with my purchace.Would suggest peeps to go for it.I'm Lov'n it already! 🙂\\n\", \"\\n  Overall seams good,I gave 2 star for battery life,Inspite of power charger it's take too long to get full charge.

Even not have an expected Samsung quality.\\n', \"\\n  It's a very nice mobile phone considering the price range and configuration it comes in. I'm using it for a little over 2months now.PRO's:1. Has amazing  camera  quality.2.Battery live is good as well..lasts me for a little over 24 hours. With YouTube, Shopping and other basic use.3. Speakers are pretty loud..exceeds expectations.4.Font and other icons display is larger than usual...will be useful  for the elderly folks.5. Over all look and feel is good.CON's:1. It's not fast charging as claimed. It takes round 2 to 3 hrs to full charge with wifi and other apps running. Else it takes 2hour to fully charge with all apps closed & wifi turned off.2.Fringer print recognition is not accurate,it atleast takes 3 -4 attempts to recognize it.3.Too big to fit in pocket. Uncomfortable to ride he bike with it in the pocket.4.Body is delicate-my phone slipped from my hand without any force..it has a dent on the backside.\\n\", '\\n  I\\'m reviewing my Samsung Galaxy M21 phone after 15 days usage & If someone tells me to say something about it in minimum words then I\\'ll say \"\"It is Awesome\"\". It is a perfect NON-CHINESE phone in mid range for me, I was too confused about it even after purchasing it but when i used this, I\\'m loving it.Pros:1. It\\'s huge 6000mah battery survives 36 to 40 hrs in normal usage.2. Super AMOLED display having very nice colour contrast and all.3. Camera, it\\'s selfie camera having wide angle photo option & flash too and rear cameras also clicks very nice pictures, even in night both the cameras satisfies me and are very good in this price range.4. Latest Android 105. OneUI 2.0 support which having many enexpected features like you can use more than one apps simultaneously on single screen by minimising them, and we can generate a floating button for screenshot capture, screen off & many more functions, you can hide apps, and zipped apps for saving battery and many more.6. It\\'s Exynos 9611 processor gives a smooth performance, no lag noticed in 15 days usage.7. And one of the major factor is that it is a Non-Chinese mobile.Iske alawa bohot kuchh hai isme jo maine expect bhi nahi kiya tha.Cons:1. One thing I don\\'t like in it is it\\'s cheap Plastic body which is susceptible to scratches but you can manage with it by protecting it with a back cover.2. It takes approx. 3 hrs to fully charge.Bus PUBG nahi khela maine isme. So I can\\'t say anything about that.👍Otherwise, It completely satisfies me.😍😍😍\\n', '\\n  Display is the highlight. Best display on budget phone.Battery life is acceptable above 1 day of normal use. Charging takes much more time.Dont buy it for playing pubg. Battery heats up and after one hour very high frame drops and frequent restarting.Camera is way better than any other phones in the range. Skin tones and colour reproduction is somewhat natural.Overall good buy in the price range except for gaming.\\n', \"\\n  All of you guys know what are the plus points. Let me tell you the negative points-1. Camera is kind of ok ok, I have Realme 2 pro 16 mp sony sensor.. both are kind of same. But Samsung's hdr and dynamic range is superb.2. Battery not optimized. Maybe next update will fix this issue. Screen on time 8 to 9 hours. No gaming.3. Samsung running on February security patch. But my Realme 2 pro 1.5 year's old device running on latest security patch. Samsung's update policy is worst.4. Sometimes UI freezes just for 1 second. Not an issue of processor. UI needs more improvement.Hope it helps! Cheers!\\n\", \"\\n  Review after using 10 days..This Mobile has lot of issues..1. Network reception- This is really  lower than other mobiles..  There is low network  in my house but other mobiles work perfectly.. In this mobile, network i m getting is almost negligible..2. Battery Issue - company  claims  it to have 6000MH, but it drains too fast. I have compared with my 2 years old MI phone(4000mh). This phone drains little faster than mi. So what's the point of claiming  6000 mh3. Voice audio quality - quality  of the voice which you listen in your ear while talking to some is really bad like a cheaper phone's. Mostly  you need to be very attentive  to listen.4. Heating issue - And I have also read the reviews  that people are also having  heating  issues. Though  I don't have this issue still..\\n\", \"\\n  After using samsung m21 and verifying  its features I reviewed as fallowsLiked features.  1. sAmoled  display  2. Processor/interface  3. Finger print sensation time, face  recognition  time.  4. 6000mah battery life  5. Light weightSpecifications which does not meet expectations are as fallows (i.e  defects)  1. Heats up while charging  2. Under 10k phone we are getting  18w fast charging facility why not in  this case?  We get 15w fast charge  facility here but it's feel like we are  charging our battery from past 1  day  3.camera does not satisfied expectation  Lag in frame rates. Cameras are not  at their best  4. We are buying phone at  it's best  price but company fails to provide  its protection by avoiding temper  guard,backcover.  5. Low sound enhancement quality  6. Fails to provide premium back  design.By reviewing all features.I conclude it's better to buy other reliable cellphone under same price.If you are a samsung lover go for it.If not go through other device features and grab a better among one.Think twice before investing  some buks on cellphone. Grab better one .\\n\", \"\\n  It is the worst mobile I ever had. Company claims saying Gorrilla glass 5 protection is not justified as its screen broken with a single slip while sitting in the chair from my jeans pocket. Further no one is there to listen. We feel so bad that in India where there is world's largest market of mobile consumers, still there is no best mobile which can compete these Chinese cheap and best mobiles. I love my India. So will wait....\\n\", '\\n  The battery is not actually 6000mAh but slightly less which is around 5830mAh the battery comes around for 18 hours on intensive usage which is quite good for a phone on this budget. I love the texture of the phone. But it slips a lot when used without a case better go for a spigen case which is really good combination with the phone. The interface of the phone is quite simple and very easy to use . For people with smaller hands it is quite hard to reach the top with single hand . The camera is great but it goes hazy for night shots.Overall it is a great phone .\\n', '\\n  I had to wait for long for this mobile as I was told that this is getting sold out very soon. And indeed it stands upto its reputation. To sum up, solid built quality, excellent display,  fast processor make it stands apart from its Chinese competitors. Don\\'t Get fooled by its specs which say that it has polycarbonate body. Its rock solid chassis justifies its price. I\\'m not a gamer but I bought it for my mom.  So it\\'s perfectly alright. The battery life reminds me of old \"Hero Honda \" ad of \" just fill it and forget it\" . The speaker is not that too loud but quality of music through headphones is very good especially when you switch on Dolby atmos. I used sennheiser px80 to test it. So please don\\'t waste time and grab it.\\n', \"\\n  My review after using 1 month of this phoneDemerits:-1.Charging problemMostly it takes 2:30 to 3 hr for full charge and sometime(when heating) it charge only10% in an hour2.Internet speed meter not available3.Private safe/space not available for photos or videos4.Its maximum brightness is even low, & doesn't give proper view in high sunlight5.Wifi wps not available6.Not works properly in low wifi range or less wifi catching capacity7.AppLock not available8.Heating problemMerits:-1.Good battery2.Camera quality is also good3.Screen display(SAD) is excellent4.Fingerprint sensor is also excellent5.its Samsung, not any ChineseNeither indian company nor Chinese but made/assembled in IndiaAfter all cons and pros overall phone is very good.

However after Noida plant Samsung is in no mood to spare Chinese mobile companies.Request to all my friends.. pls find one suitable phone from samsung or other indian companies as per ur requirement. However in absence of good phones from from india we can give Samsung a try. All price range and ROM and RAM options available.

I never bought them because i never liked Samsung's UI.So overall happy but a 3 star rating for the device because of the defect inside one of the camera lens i don't know how that happened. But i am not happy seeing it. I know this is a low-budget phone. But i do not expect such carelessness from samsung. I know its a small thing and i can still take photos but i don't feel good that it's there.I wanted this phone urgently, i have use for it. So i cannot even replace this phone because I need it. Once the lockdown is lifted i will have to visit the service center.Such a good device. But a small thing that ruins the experience Samsung. I don't know how quality check misses this.\\n\", '\\n  Ultimate phone.Excellent finger print reader, display, battery back up is fantastic, speed of processor is like bullet, camera quality is excellent better than other brand s phone of even higher range, memory is more than enough, in this budget this mobile is incomparable with any other brand.I am writing this review after six months of usage.Must buy..\\n', \"\\n  This phone is very much similar to Samsug M30s. Some few differences include 20 MP front camera and android 10 in M21. First I bought M30s four month before and now I bought M21 because the price was lower by 2000/- compare to M30s.The phone performs decently in almost all aspects except battery backup. The M21 is giving highly disappointing battery backup. Even though Samsung claims that it is a 6000 mAh battery, it won't last for more than One & half day with normal usage like phone calling, messaging, WA and some banking or office apps.My M30s with same 6000 mAh, was giving (I lost it and so I bought M21) me the battery backup of 3 to 4 days leisurely.If battery life matters for you, don't go for M21, instead buy M30s only.\\n\", \"\\n  not satisfied at all. its front cam is pathetic which has filter by default, my redmi 5A, 3 year old phone worth 6999 takes much much MUCH BETTER photos than this disgusting ''Samsung smart phone''. There was an issue of switching on of hotspot which was sorted out after contacting the Samsung agent for around 39 min.  These phones are refurbished phones and not brand new phones which i didn't know and we cant return it as its not in the  policy, we can only replace them. LOL. well.....i just wanted a budget smart phone not COMPROMISE, which now i have to. My personal suggestion-if anyone wants to buy Samsung, buy it from the store not online coz these are not new and would definitely create problems.\\n\", \"\\n  1. I put the phone on charging, but it ran into a boot loop for no reason. Then I opened in factory mode. But after choosing to restart, it would again go in boot loop. Then I choose safe mode. But it did not come back to normal mode despite many efforts and restarts. The only way to restart it in normal mode was to format it. So, I had to.With my experience in the first month, I knew the phone is not stable. Nor it is reliable. So configured important folders for auto backup on Onedrive so I won't lose important photos and Data again.2. The battery is ok, yet I think not 6000mah. My 3 years old phone with 4000mah used to run for the same one day. It runs a few extra hours than the old one.Rest is no issue.\\n\", '\\n  After 1 month of usage this r my observations :)Pros:1) Excellent screen2) Great battery backup (u will have to tweak some settings to get the best battery backup).3) Decent camera performance.4) fast fingerprint sensor.5) Non-Chinese brand.Cons:1) Average processor.2) Poor Low light camera performance.3) Poor pubg performance.4) 15W fast charger is not enough takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the phone.5) No protective case in the box.Overall: If u r looking for a reliable Non-Chinese phones for day to day tasks and light gaming then just go for this phone.\\n', '\\n  I bought M21 (4gb, 64gb), delivered on 27th june. Notice a distinct yellow tint on display (whites are ivory). have tried multiple options: vivid mode- white balance, rgb tweak, adaptive brightness, dark mode, blue light filter off, no success. Tried to search a bit, looks a like lot of people are facing yellow tint issues with Android 10 UI 2.0. Samsung: is there a fix for this?. I have a S8+ (which luckily I cant upgrade to android 10). Screen tone of S8+ (whites are whites!) and M21 (ivory whites!) are quite different. Apart from this, proximity sensor working is intermittent, voice quality on video call is pathetic! Samsung, what do I do with this phone- return option not appearing/ replacement is showing..that too if smartchk app finds something wrong (these problems are not even listed). So all doors closed? Of all the problems, worst is the display..causing severe eye strain and headaches. As of now using at near zero brightness level. Suggestion to prospective buyers: pls look elsewhere! Samsung: please suggest a solution (for what its worth, I am regular Samsung customer, using 5 devices- mobiles/ appliances as of now). This one was a real disappointment! Kindly help!\\n', '\\n  An amazing phone, been using it for almost 20 days.Absolutely no unwanted Bloatware like the Chinese phones, an amazing Battery which lasts almost upto 2 days, with continuous WiFi Google meet and Zoom calls, Fair amount of E mails, Surfing and online streaming.Super fast Finger print scanner, very easy to setup. Solid build quality, with good look and feel of the phone.Good camera for the price point almost matches my iPhone XR. Super fast charging with Type C. Go for the 128gb version it makes more sense.This is any day better than the cheap Chinese copies on sale today.And oh yes forgot to mention this is 100% Made in India\\n', \"\\n  Face detecter -*****Fingerprint- *****Processor-*****Camera- ***** very much satisfy with camera performance..Gaming- 4gb is not for gaming..But as a multitasker this phone will satisfy you....Charger 'taking 2 hours to fully charged the phone..Overall phone performance eith battery backup os amazing... as per my personal opinion I am using this phone gor last 2 week....i noticed no problem means no lagging no screen burn .....worth it..value for money\\n\", \"\\n  After 3 days of use I am posting this, bought this phone for my wife who was using Redmi Note 5.Small things which is available in competition products with lesser or same price makes lot of difference. After 6 years of experience with Xiaomi we did lot of Research to change and chosen Samsung as preferred one.But am little disappointed with the performance here is pro's & cons.Pro's:1. Slim and very light to handle2. Audio output3. Lot of features inbuilt4. Battery backup ( comes 1&half day for moderate use)5. WiFi direct callingCons:1. >2 hrs charging time2. Doesn't feels like 48 megapixel & 20 megapixel front camera.3. Screen notifications are worst, you don't have screen led light blinking when any notifications come, so everytime you have to touch the screen to check for notifications.4.  Doesn't provide back case which competition does.5. Plastic back panel looks like ordinary phone for which you have to spend 16k.Overall not fully satisfied with this phone. As mentioned Samsung, has a big brand should small things should be implemented.\\n\", '\\n  Wow Samsung u r amazingHuge 6000mah battery with fast chargingI have 4gb ram and 64gb variantCamera is a beastGood battery life goes 1.5days with heavy playing game ,showing YouTube video ,chatting ,etc.Full charged around 2.5 hoursLight weightThanks Samsung and Amazon\\n', '\\n  Nice phone battery is good ,camera is ok  but lacks most options like samsung pass, mini pay compared to ASeriesTakes long hours to charge min of 2.5 hrs.My sincere request Is to not buy this model\\n', \"\\n  This product is good..I am student who got this phone for online classes every day  for 4hrs and 2hr 30min everyday tution plus my space 2hrsIt last for this full time.Continuously usingIt does get hotBut cools in some timeIt's been a more since I am using it perfect for me only thing no clipboard but downloaded it from Google keyboardCharging give an hour starting it loses it battery after a week it gets better and after the update on the phone its much better.I purchased a 4gb as well as a 6gbThis review is for the 6gbAnd this 6gb phone will last for 4to5 yearsAnd 4gb for 2to3 years6gb has more space than 4gb hence lifespan moreHope this gives u some idea about the phone..this is my honest reviewI hope this is helpful\\n\", \"\\n  I love this phone and currently have no complaints regarding it. But I would love even more if its sound quality would be better. The only thing I hate about this phone is the plastic body which seems too brittle to break, but it's quite strong enough. Its 6000 mAh battery is too long-lasting and could easily give you a battery backup of 1.5 days. I even play games on it and it can easily handle COD mobile and PUBG mobile on medium settings. But if you want to play on high-end settings, I won't recommend this phone. I got this deal at 12699 and compared to the price I have paid, I am completely satisfied. Thank you Samsung and Amazon for the best delivery experience as expected.\\n\", \"\\n  REVIEWING after 1 month.Bought it for INR 12,699. It took around 2 hrs to 2.30 hrs to get fully charged. Amazing display. Sound is equally good. I didn't try installing heavy gaming apps. Camera app has lot of features. Worth for money. That's all I would say.Pros:👍 Type C cable with fast charging.👍 Camera is excellent[support super slow motion videos].👍 Decent battery.👍 Super AMOLED display.👍 Comes with android 10.Cons:👎 USB cable is little short.👎 No earphone.👎 Lot of preinstalled apps like helo, tiktok,...\\n\", \"\\n  I bought this phone for my mother but used it for couple of weeks until I orderd Vivo z1x for myself. My mother is a casual gamer and plays light games. She also watches lots of videos and stream movies. And according to her needs I found this phone a perfect match at an unbelievable price (12699). I was looking for an amoled screen as it causes less strain on eyes.Display : Display is super awesome. Very bright and accurately colorful. I use Vivo z1x (Super amoled) and Samsung's display is far superior than of Vivo's. Daylight visibility is very good.Battery : Battery backup is excellent. It is easily giving 9 to 10 hours of screen on time. Charge it once and use it entire day without worry. Buttttt there is a major con, charging speed. It's 15w charger charges the phone very sluggishly. It takes almost 2 hours and 45 minuts to charge it fully.Camera : Camera performance is mediocre. It isn't great. Photos are good in daylight condition but things get bad in low light. Selfie Camara is also mediocre. Considering the price, Camara performance justifies the price.Sound : Speaker output is decently loud and clear. Headphone output is outstanding (because of Dolby atmos support).User interface : Phone runs on One UI android 10. It is majorly seamless with no lag. One UI is nice and feels premium. It has many customization options. There are no annoying ads or recommendations.Gaming : Phone performs excellent in light gaming. No major lag. Since my mother plays light games only, it serves the purpose well. Buttttt if you are a heavy gamer, please skip it without hesitation.Network : There is no issue in network or calling. Video streaming is also excellent. Good network reception.Cons :1. Sometimes finger print sensor is hit and miss. It annoys, you just keep rubbing your finger on the sensor and nothing happens.2. If you are a heavy user (who uses lots of games and apps) then phone will not feel smooth.3. Charging speed is very poor. In this fast lifestyle, it's very hard to manage with slow charging.4. Mediocre camera performance.5. Face unlock is bit slow and doesn't perform good in low light.Conclusion : I wanted to buy a phone for my mother and this phone fulfilled all the needs such as Amoled screen, big battery, decent processor, good sound output. Camera wasn't my priority. Overall very satisfied with the product.\\n\", '\\n  Samsung Phone purchased not at all a good quality product . in just 7 days, it is dead and no body even at customer service is responding us , they are saying it is used product and incorrect invoice  ,it is sheer waste of money.amazon agents are also misguiding .... even at call centre ,they have told us to wait, when the time for replacement gets over , they simply denied to help us old . we end uploosing rs 14000/- because of their wrong guidance.  i will not recommend anybody even to purchase any product from amazon , this is the third time that i am getting a such a  product .the product is defective and second hand ,low grade .battery got heat up like burning sensation , discharged early , touch pad is not working and got dead ,no response ,  a used ,second hand product .whoever is reading my review ,please do not buy from  here , they will cheat with you . you will end up paying and got loss .Samsung service engineer is saying ,do not buy from amazon , they are cheating people  and they are getting lot of complain regarding this now a days but refused to entertain us .we are in doldrums what to do next ..........kindly guide .\\n', '\\n  I have bought this smartphone around 3 month ago. Below is my experiencePros.1. Smooth amold display will blow your heart. You will definently like display and color of display.2. 6000mah Battary will provide you breakthrough performance. You dont need to charge again and again like other phone. Charge once and use whole day.3. Camera Obviously  48 mp back camera and 20mp front will provide you amazing photography experience i am not good in clicking pictures. Hence i uploaded some of photos. I belive you can do better than me.4. It have 4GB RAM so you can do multitasking eseily. No lag while playing PUBG or COD whith high graphics setting.5. If have game launcher which is amazing feature providing by samsung. Like it will track time spending on a single game, while playing if someone calling you will get very short popup to receive call or not.6. Again amazon sevice did great work even in lockdown. (5 out of 5).7. Manufacturing in india. And samsung relible brand.Cons.1. Charging time is too long even it have fast charging still you have to give 2hour to 2 hour 30 minute for full charging.2. I didnt like back side look but i still bought beacuse of feature and brand value and pricing.So overall my final rating is 4.7 out of 5. You should go for it.\\n', \"\\n  The phone has these positive sides :1. Great display. AMOLED is hands down better than any other technology.2. Great Battery life.3. Great software experience with ONEUI.4. Great form factor with low weight. samsung made the phone completely out of plastic to adjust for the wt of the battery.5. Type C charger.The bad parts:1. Speaker output could have been better.And that's it. It is a great phone with a great display- the actual thing u tend to look at all day round.GET IT and be HAPPY.\\n\", \"\\n  Rear camera 5 starsFront camera doesn't work well in low lightFingerprint reader is slower than other brand phones in this rangeFace lock is also slowBattery life is pretty good 5 starsBeautiful display 5 startsOS 5 starsAfter 4 months of usageBattery life is not made for gaming or mobile hotspot it's not a monster battery not even a little.Heats up crazy during gaming and extreme usage don't recommend sleeping next to it.Quality is not up to the mark for safety and performance reasons I don't recommend this phone to any young people.Camera quality is just ok. 3stars/5stars\\n\", \"\\n  I have been using this phone for the last one month and till now I did not see any technical defect in it.  This is Samsung's best budget phone so far.  I would like to give it a full 5 stars out of 5, with excellent emulated display, great processor, battery performance and camera quality.\\n\", '\\n  The Samsung M21 is a budget smartphone with professional features at a pocket friendly price. The smartphone has 48 MP camera that does justice to photos and videos. The phone has a dual sim which means it is like carrying two phones in one, without the need to lug two physical phones. The phone has VoLTE capability and supports the latest 4G SIM cards and protocols. The massive battery is a boon for those who need to keep on \"chatting/talking non-stop\". The fingerprint reader is located on the rear side and is extremely fast in responding to fingerprint recognition. It is a great buy at the given price. Go for it.\\n', '\\n  This my review after 4 days of purchase.  I bought this for my mother who is a teacher. She wanted a phone with screen recorder. As all classes are online for the past few months due to Covid teachers r taking online classes and submitting the same to their heads. As her old phone did not support recording on 2 mics I had purchased this phone as it is a non Chinese best brand. Butto my shock it does not support 2 mics and for her it is a waste. All other mid-range chinese phones support recording which is in built. I did not expect this from such a good brand.  This forces us to buy Chinese phones though we want to boycott Chinese products. I hope Samsung brings in a new update to correct this problem.\\n', \"\\n  Regualr updates are required to boost system and software  performance.Camera is awesome rear and front.Functions are smooth and buttery .Watching movies and videos are very pleasant.But Some of the bloatware and third party apps  like Helo,likee,etc are yuck and must not be preinstalled. Thank God We can uninstall  them.Go for it .You wont regret except for regular android updates. only Feb month software update is provided so far by default. DONT KNOW if they provide regular security update or not.But it's  performance is by far smooth and well.While Doing DUO video call I felt heating of phone.Let's  see if it is improved in next security update.Samsung should provide headphones,back cover, tempered  glass with phones at their end.Regards,Edit:31may 2020Yesterday  took 30/40 photos and my phone Galaxy M21 appeared hot.Photos were quite good.What astonished me is this phone's  battery management .It generally takes three days to discharge.Actually I am a moderate user So It's expected but want the same performance in future. Samsung's own EXYNOS processor needs overhauling in comparison  to qualcom snapdragon and media  tech..Will add further information in due course02 june2020YouTube playback is sometimes stuck which I Experienced two three times.Software update is major issue.My preused samsung headphone is not compatible with its Jack.Loose .So doesn't works it ought  to be.My Nokia is much better than this phone is every aspect.Not a single time Hang or stuck during any usage.Samsung's  main problem is its processor which is required to be reengineered.In 30 july2020 got an update which was done  vastly. It feels good when the phone is updated regularly since it removes glitches and boosts performance.Samsung is listening its consumers I guess so it is providing updates.What I see in this update is battery is draining  a little faster than before.I am satisfied.Samsung should provide earphone, backcover and screen guard with every models I reiterate.Regards,My review is being altered.for some days  this phone has gone unexpectedly unresponsive. Touch is hectic and the display panel is heated .Samsung has provided me used phone by Amazon. I swear I will never buy  and persuade anyone to buy Samsung mobile ever.\\n\", '\\n  So I hv used it now for two days and here are my reviews:phone is big enough at this range. Performance is great. There is a dark mode avalable for all android system which I really liked. I am more into camera and I will rate this camera 4. There is too much exposure for photos. But night mode is too good. THis is perfect for low light imaging. But it will overexpose, so u will have to reduce the brightness. Also normal video will zoom a bit which I dont like. But u can shoot it in wide view as well which gives it a different feeling. The pro mode of camera for photos is less adjustable but it can overcome these limitations very well.The battery certainly lasted about 1.5 day on average usage with games, photos videos etc. At this price I think this is a v good deal.\\n', \"\\n  Yes.Cost efficiency is what i would call the super trait of M21 to be.This is the worthiest set to be bought at around ₹ 15k. Best Battery capacity and display (super AMOLED!) at this rate. Decent chipset.Been using it for a month. And it, indeed, is very good in overall performance and is more cost effective than I thought. In fact more cost effective than all the Mid Range phones I've bought so far.A massive 6000mAh Battery will sustain the phone for minimum a day but to be honest it does not deserve the hype it got. Also inclusion of a faster charger would have made me happier. But im still happy man!It Does heat up a little bit while charging. But seriously manages to keep the cool even while heavy RAM usage.The design is not appealing coming with a plastic body. This is a small negative which is overshadowed by the remaining overwhelming positives of M21.The april 2020 update is good. Trust me.If ever there is an offer where there is a rate drop below 14000 for a 4-64 variant then go for it.\\n\", \"\\n  My own experience of 3 days:-Battery- not working good as expected 6000 mah,it's looks like 3500mah.Camera-this is pretty good ,image quality is good.Fingerprints-some times fails to read ir fingerprints otherwise it's good .Network- I'm facing network issues with this phone ,internet connection some time collapse,and also my relatives complaint that he can't able to call me,but I can call him(it's happening since 3 days when I insert my Vodafone 4g sim in my new phone....Otherwise performance is good.\\n\", \"\\n  All Parameters are excellent other than below mentioned Points I observed.-Battery Backup- with a normal Usage it will go from 100 to 35% (From 5am till 8pm), less than expected. Actually Some Background Apps consumes so much battery which can't be Disabled.-Camera is OK OK (Doesnt appear to be  48MP quality, there is no in depth clarity in pixels with artificial light), daylight quality is good.(Very very Slight Heating is always there), you can feel it in pocket.-You can't disable notifications related to auto update of apps.-Face Unlock doesnt works sometimes in little dim light,in Light it is good.-No option to display data speed over status bar.-Settings menu is little bit not user friendly. Little bit confusing.- My Backup from Google Drive could not be restored, as it was showing try again later, Tried two times but didn't work, you can only avail this option during setting it first time.Whats app Backup Restored.-Data speed was not good as it was in my last phone(just an Observation)\\n\", '\\n  I bought 6/128 gb variantscreen resolution, camera quality no doubt is awesome.Battery personally i dont geel like 6000mah coz i dont play games still get only 1 day backup..But one day is quite decent but not as of 6000mah.But facing some problems , i dont know it is only with me or with anyone else??Plz tell me anyone who bought it had this pblem or not..1. Every time I insert sd card , it shows a display with message that issue with sd card and format it.If i only insert sd card then there is no issue but the issue came when i insert both sd card and sim cards together..I cheked it many times ,all the time it shows same....I dont know what to do...2. Moderate heating of mobile near earpiece during charging..3. Some lag when i was doing screen mirroring...Plz tell anyone else having these problem or not..if yes then what he does ??If no then plz suggest what should i do..Replace the device as it is only 3 days old..\\n', '\\n  After 12 days of usesBattery okCamera goodGood product value of money\\n', \"\\n  I had been always buying budget phones from Chinese brands for my Parents until now. Then I heard about the new Samsung M Series range of phones making sensation in the market with Super AMOLED screen and good configurations for the price. Decided to give it a try this time and ordered the M21 for my dad. Upon receiving the phone, I was blown away by the almost everything this phone was offering in this price range. The screen quality is amazing with definite 2 days battery life. The performance of the phone is more than adequate and easily compares to any other sub 15k phones, but the camera quality, battery and the screen quality surpasses almost all others in this segment. The screen quality is better than even my twice expensive phone which is having IPS TFT panel.Pros:Great screenCamera qualityBattery backupPerformanceSoftware refinementCons:Weight. But its justifying given the massive battery size.Plastic Body. But to be frank, we use phones with cases. So in that case, plastic body is safer than glass. So not a con actually.No bundled earphones. That too can't be really complained in this price range and also currently, no one is supplying the same.Verdict:I am loving it more and my dad is also happy since its a Korean and non Chinese brand and Proudly Made in India phone. This purchase made me order an M31 for my mother the next day, since she is really keen on phone camera quality than my dad, and since this 13k phone amazing for its camera, was having even high hopes for an 18k phone which is having higher camera specs.\\n\", '\\n  I have been using this phone since 2 weeks.Pros1. Manufactured in India2. Display is really good. I can surely distinguish this from my old phone3. Battery life last more than a day even after high usage4. Dolby atmos sound enhances video and audio experience5. Camera is fantastic. Does a good job for a noob photographer like meCons1. Charging wire could have been little longer2. I miss led notification lightOver all Samsung has done a very good job in mid range segment. At this price I did not wanted to purchase some other brand with UI that is more like a adware\\n', \"\\n  Bought in Amazon india. As mentioned,product was made in India.Which I liked.Comes with ejector pin, travel adapter and usb, and manual with warranty.It supports fast charging. It was mentioned that The USB cable was made in austria. adapter made in India.Takes quite long process while initial start. Make sure that you select what you need.Pros1.Country of Origin-For buyers who look for Made in India phones,definitely you could get this.2.Battery suits for very normal users.3.security Mcafee comes with this. we need to turn on for security.4.Processor is ok.5.Super AMOLED display6.No heating issues.7.Android 10 with UICons1.Mono speaker.2.Camera light output is low. Camera wasn't appreciating. For this price camera design should have been better.3.Lot of preinstalled apps,which I don't like.4.Takes quite long time to charge. Even fast charging mode switched. This was unexpected.5.No headphones or screen guard provided. We need to buy separately.6.Dolby gets switched only when you use headset,bluetooth headset mode.ConclusionGood phone for normal users. I think it won't suit for heavy smartphone users.\\n\", '\\n  Just after 2 weeks of purchase, this Samsung M21 smartphone suddenly got hung and a portion of the screen is not responsiive. Immediately I  raised a complaint. The technical guy of customer care not even bothered to listen to the complaint. He just told that the return policy expired two days back, just two days and I dont even know about it. How can one expect that this kind of cheap goods being delivered to us. They can stop working at any time if they are too cheap. Amazon thinks the customers are like fools living in amazon forest. They should consider the complaint and need to respond in a constructive way. IN this pandemic matter of two days should be considered and extended.Apart from all these, the service is so bad and irresponsible. They are saying go to the samsung service centre. If we can go there why should one buy from your site? Because we believe better service from you irrespective of who the seller is. If its an offline purchase we should have checked every thing there itself physically. Since its Amazon we blindly ordered just by seeing images but later realized that it is also like ultra low grade e-marketing company after talking to this customer service guy. I just dont want to take his name. When I say how can we go out in this circumstances as ours is containment zone. He simply told not to order from amazon as they also cant deliver here. Amazon should seriously look into this guys behaviour. He is going to make you loose many customers.Finally, I suggest not to buy electronic products, particularly samsung brand from Amazon. Please go and buy offline. They are also suggesting the same indirectly.\\n', \"\\n  Good product by SamsungBut I think samsung is also going the way of other cheap China mobiles by selling our data. Maybe to tackle the competition?First time when I switched on and starting updates I found other party apps like like videos ,Facebook and other unnecessary  apps started to get installed without my permission.But later these things have to be removed  settings tweaked to tackle the problem and it was really tough.Wasn't expecting this from samsung.(may be they thought that this is low end phone so why to worry?)Camera is good for its priceFingerprint reader and face recognition lock are useless in this price tag as you know if u mind or security as a basic\\n\", \"\\n  \\xa0I Ordered this product on 28th july 2020 and recevied the delivery packet by 30th july 5:00pm (Delivery speed was good though.)I payed the order amt to delivery guy and after receiving the payment, he handed over me the phone. And full of curiosity i opened the delivery packet in front of  delivery guy.what i found is that phone box has all the accessories perfectly But the sad part is phone itself was missing.I mean did i just paid 13999 rupees for a samsung charger and a data cable and ofcourse the sim ejecting tool.Just warning you guys , maybe you won't even get the charger , data cable and sim ejecting tool .Be Careful While paying at this Product or even any other product from Amazon.So, this is the real face of amazon india services . this is their customer satisfaction and after sales service.I dont know that who was faulty at this , it can be the seller , delivery agency , or warehouse staff(as it was FBA product) . But the responsiblity of managing all of this goes to Amazon Only and that's why they charge high comission fees from sellers.\\n\", '\\n  Just purchased this phone as i had no other option as i dont support chinese product anymore.The picture quality of the phone is great but the phone starts hanging while using whatsapp. Even after using it for 15min the phone becomes heated . To disconnet the call you need to tap twice on the cancel  button.I had used Samasung Galaxy J7 few years back and it was my worst experience ever. I thought Samsung being such a big company might have improved the quality after years. But i was wrong.Strong suggestion to buyers....Never go for Samsung , keep it as a last option to buy.\\n', \"\\n  Purchased Galaxy M21 for sister as it is non-Chinese. But now I am regretting not buying other brand. Such pathetic M series was not expected from Samsung.Only gud thing abt this phone is Amoled display, large battery and decent camera.Rest everything is impractical...be it1. Plastic back- plastic back is finger print magnate and will get scratches easily.2.Rear fingerprint placement- fingerprint position is so upward that literally u need to find it . Also it is so flat with back body making diffictly in distinguishing fingerprint sensor with back body.3. Slow Processor- processor is slow/laggy. Phone started getting slow from 1st day of usage. Slow opening of app or buffering type slow response which irritates a lot.4. Heating issue- Most pathetic thing abt this phone is its heating issue. Means it will heat more at earpiece area only(upper part of phone). I have used other phones also...but samsung makes record among all in term of heating issue.5. No screen protector and phone cover- Many brands which are much cheaper than Samsung and gives equal quality at low price, include screen protector and phone cover but I don't know why Samsung is doing this. Now I will have to buy it separately.Overall I am disappointed with Samsung mid range phones as they are not made for practical purpose. It will not be wrong to say why brands like Mi, realmse got big boom over Samsung. They provide every practical need which we want.Sorry samsung but this will be my last purchase of samsung phone.\\n\", \"\\n  After around 2 months of using Samsung M21(6GB/128GB) phone it developed display problem..Also some network signal strength issues is seen after switching to this phone...I had to spend Rs 5484/- for changing display as they were telling display is not covered under warranty, many people are facing this issue. Better don't buy this phone.Fingerprint scanner is good Camera is average only.Battery will run for almost 1.5 days with single charging.\\n\", \"\\n  First I bought this phone as my old phone bricked and I needed one urgently. Only criteria was a not a made in china decently modern phone. This one a21 and 31 were trending in market though my research 6 months back wanted me to buy an a50 something these two had the same features CPU etc and processor but lesser ram and storage and one camera less and some megapixels lesser but who needs them anyway. All I need is one decent camera on each side.The camera in this is decent and has multiple modes and options like AR AI and wide angle and so on. Its confusing and I felt not in control. So sticking to 16:9 standard pics. Still the depth is pixelated even at 48 MP.The amoled screen is amazing in vivid colors though it can be quite hard on the eyes. I am keeping it in dark mode mostly and there is also a blue filter. There are also calm modes which put the phone in black and white and do not disturb mode for me time  away from phone.The phone is quite bulky by today's standards about a centimeter with a cover. It doesn't have 5g support either which many new phones bring.This is a mostly made in india phone with exception of charger cable from Vietnam and I am sure the processor and circuits made in Taiwan or china. Nevertheless it was refreshing to see a made in india phone designed by Samsung in a world where anything we buy is made in china. Though I must say the finish of the product and packing is not of such high quality as chineese brands like xiaomi vivo not even compare to one+. But the product itself is of higher quality than chineese phones.The cost is much higher than normal times perhaps due to pandemic or import curbs from china. Atleast 4k more. Such phones are in the 10k range but still feature to feature similar prized mi or others have more cameras and glass body and many more features. Brought this only cos of Made in India.but it has to become  competitive in terms of quality and price to be successful.Update: After a weeks use updating to 5 star. 3 day battery though no real fast charging takes 3 hrs to charge full. Performance is top notch no lag or hang and smooth even with extra animations enabled. Overall happy with the phone.\\n\", '\\n  Pros:1. I got this mobile against exchange which was good deal2. I also got approx 1200/ addnl deal wrt bank3. Excellent budgeted smart phone In this price range4. 6.4-inch/Super Amoled/FHD / Resolution (2340 x 1080) and 16M color support5. Triple Camera - 48MP Main Camera +8MP Ultra Wide Camera +5MP and 20MP front camera6. Android with  10.0 operating sys 1.7GHz Octa-Core processor, 6GB RAM, 128GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB and dual SIM- 4GCons:1. It’s not 5G handset2. Battery Charger is ordinary ( no quick charger) neither wattage is mentioned on charger- disappointing3. Ear phone is not a part of box which is disappointing.4. Face ID not avlble5. Samsung should limit number of apps that comes with handsets. This unnecessarily lowers down the speed as well storage.\\n', \"\\n  Battery life is the main USP of this M series, camera quality is not upto expected but at this price range seeing the other specs the little camera quality can be compromised and if you can really want a good camera then go for M31 or M31s . samsung gives the best amoled display it's a no brainer. Fingerprint is very fast , face unlock is good but not at best but fingerprint unlock works really fast, phone runs smooth as well I'm not a gammer so don't know about that , there is little heating issue only while charging the phone , otherwise I haven't noticed heating issue, the phone comes with minimal blootware that's the best , it is not like any Chinese brands like MI , oppo , realme where you notice adds , so in this samsung one UI there is a near to a stock android experience without blootware and adds and that's very good as well\\n\", '\\n  I loved this phoneThis has pure samsung flaship level touchresponse.Amoled display is amazing.Battery is amazing.And apart from all theseLook very expensive one in black color .Camera is good .Not heating .Network reception is amazing .Call quality is good .Speaker is good.Its like you hold jewel in your hand .This fone doesnt looks like cheap smartphones like redmi xaomi and real me .Build quality is amazing .If you are not a gamer then go for it under 20k .This is best smartphones and cheapest from samsung.I have recently used realme xt but that one also not feels expensive in your hand .In every aspect this fone is far above the chineese fones.And UI is amazing like you will never get that feeling from any other chinees brand .Amazing fone go for itThink twice before going to choose chineese brand if u r not a gamer .I loved it .\\n', \"\\n  Do you want an android phone?Do you've a higher perceived brand value for Samsung?Is your budget under INR 13K?If your answer for all of these is YES, then do not wait, just buy it !*** The Processor Debate ***This Snapdragon Vs. Exonys Vs. Mediatek etc, this is all just topics of debate for youtubers. They need content for their channels, don't put your mind in tizzy unless you are a heavy gamer and your life depends on nano-seconds of lag.Yes all these processor debate end at the difference of nano seconds which in real life is even way beyond blink and miss. You can't notice it even if you are Rajnikant. So chose a phone which is VFM for you.*** Perceived Brand Value of Samsung ***Lets just put it out here, Samsung is the Apple of Android world. Right or wrong ? 100% Right !!For me, i always recommended Xiaomi phones to folks who want innovation on a budget. But if you want and Apple but one running Android then Samsung is best bet for you.*** Durability ***Samsung phones are durable and so are even MI phones. I have one Mi A1 still working in mint condition used by my mother. So your decision making should be based on the brand value doe you.*** Battery ***One thing Samsung has learnt for its entry level and mid level offerings is to rightly capture the need. People need large capacity batteries because mobile phone has become one of our limbs, extension of our body part.Added benifit : decent camera , 3.5 mm jack.*** To Summarize ***If you do not want a Xiaomi or Real Me or Moto because you want a SAMSUNG, then go for it, because**** it has massive juice to last**** oh you've a SAMSUNG*** take those 🤳 selfiesTo suarize\\n\", '\\n  After several research and watching many you tube videos related to drop test and other stuffs bought this mobile but I regret for buying this mobile, just dropped the mobile by 2 feet height, the so called gorilla  glass broke into pieces. Very worst manufacturing just the brand name is getting marketed and sold but product is of cheap quality. Pls also see the pics of broken glass before you decide to buy. My old redmi note 4 is far better in terms of build quality.\\n', '\\n  I have been using a smaller 5\" form factor phone for almost 3-4 years. Had been wanting to buy my next phone for quite some time and finally bought this one.And I would say I\\'m content with the it.It has a vibrant display best in class I would say. I don\\'t notice the U notch for sometime of usage.Good speaker not something loud but good enough.Good cameras for the price! Some might find the selfie camera less impressive but its good enough for social media needs.Excellent battery! Better than all those 1000$ phones! 😁And the performance is fine enough for me, I get some lags here an there but nothing which makes trouble in my daily tasks. I would say the performance is same as compared to my old phone S6 Edge, which is good as it still runs smoothly! 😁 Btw, I don\\'t game much!!Perfect to gift it to your mom, dad or anyone in your family. It has good big fonts. And no bogus softwares you might see in other brands!I would say I made a right decision to not invest in a premium phone and saved a lot of money. This phone gets everything done I need and I believe most users will find it good enough too!\\n', '\\n  One of the best in market* sAMOLED 6.4 is delivering high satisfaction  Display is big, good, sharp, crisp and clear  enough, Bright colours.  one of the top reason  to go for M21*Dolby atmos gives amplified audio output* Battery is like ocean* Camera is Crystal Crisp* Fast enough* Best in budget* Video experience is just wowBut also know itBody is plastic but glossy , looks goodThe frame finishing does not give a luxurious feel. But a good cover can do that, anyways you will use a cover to protect it. So this reason should no stop you from getting M21.But when you use It, overall performance is going to be satisfying. 200 % recommend this mobile\\n', '\\n  Overall the phone is excellent at this price point.  You cannot go wrong with it.The pros1) Superb 6.3\" display with SuperAMOLED : This is really great to have. There are many higher end phones which are pricier, but every time you view on your phone the display is something that goes beyond its segment2) Awesome battery: I believe this is something very important far more than only performance.  Can be a life saver during the occasional instance when you have forgotten to charge it.  Till now  with most never dropped below 30% charge.  Have a reserve charge is good.Also:  The 15W fast charger is fast enough unlike what people believe.  Just don\\'t wait to charge it until its fully discharged.3) One UI on Android 10 and processor performance: Samsuns\\'s OneUI is decent and consistent now across devices. It looks modern and works without lags. Ofcourse its not a gamer or performance phone. But the Exynos 9611 processor is good enough for most tasks for most people.  Also I am sure Samsung will update to Android 11 and maybe even 12.4) Sales and Service: Not much direct experience, but I see that the service center availability is so much better than my previous phone (ASUS Zenfone)5) Signal Reception and SAR: Having a low SAR value is important . WIFi and call reception is excellent. Speaker is loud and clear.Cons:If I have to pick one con for this phone, its the camera. Its average - if I compare it to the ASUS Zenfone 3, a older phone - but then ASUS specializes in the camera area.So camera is average just like most phones at this price point .\\n', \"\\n  Performance of the phone is good so far. The finger print scanner is is indeed very fast but the best thing I like about this phone is its super amoled display; it is a treat to watch videos on this phone. Camera I personally don't use much, but the quality of front and rear cameras is pretty good especially the night mode which is very helpful in taking pics in low light.Looks good in hand and it is very lightweight which is an added advantage. Now the storage of 128 GB of which 100 gb is at your disposal which practically eliminates the need for external storage for an average user like me. Sound quality is also good and you can listen to your favourite music anytime.The only drawback is battery which as mentioned 6000mAh doesn't seems to be working as long as it should. It still manages to get 36 hours of usage after full charge which takes almost 2 hours with the fast charging feature.Overall considering the price range it is a very good phone with all the necessary features packed in a compact and lightweight device for the average user.\\n\", '\\n  I had purchased Samsung Galaxy M21 6GB RAM 128 GB on 3rd July. Model is good, sAmoled display good. Battery performance best. Fast Charging good. But the processor not good for gaming. I have installed Asphalt 8 car game, mobile is lagging sometime evenI have 6GB RAM model. You can use mobile for all things except Gaming. I hope Samsung will think on it and changed their mobile processor.\\n', '\\n  Nowadays Samsung comes up with new phones with different series to reach out to all kind of users.After comparing with different,lastly I go with this particular model as it comes with a full package without a burden to your pocket.😁The camera are really good for portraits and wide angles with a giant battery with very decent UI.Even my 1st phone was samsung S2, after that I loved this brand.Am not a gamer, but this fone is really smooth while handling...\\n', \"\\n  Its a shame that a phone with such great hardware does not have a competing software to complement it. Its one ui2 is inferior to MIUI found on MI/xiaomi phones IMO. If you're used to MIUI like me then some may be disapointed on software front:-pros:-battery life,camera,fast charger,excellent displaycons:-# no usb 3.1 gen2# no bluetooth 5.1 only(5.0)# no wifi 6 supportsoftware(UI) issues# missing call record option during the call.# missing native app lock feature. This is a big one as third party apps are very poor and MIUI version is great. Samsungs 'S Secure' is a breather but not as good as MI's app lock. you have to unlock each app individually in s secure and install it separately.# if you hide text message content on lock screen it gets hidden when you're logged in as well.# No messages feature which can't detect OTP's in messages.# poor file manager compared to MI and google# no support for showing network speed in status bar# no ability to set daily data limits only monthly limits can be set.# very basic messages app compared to MIUI version# more bloatware and app control than MIUI, can'e even uninstall facebook(only disable).# can't limit the number of connected devices via hotspot.# even taking screenshots is more intuitive and fast in MIUI where you just swipe three fingers down the screen or use the button in notification panel. Samsung uses yet another app for screenshots to which you have to grant permission to save the screenshot although you do not have to install it separately.Most of software limitations can be overcome by installing third party or samsung's own apps. But they will slow the phone down as native(OS) implementations are much faster. Also most of these are small usability tweaks which should not take too much efforts to implement but they will improve the user perception of their phones because many people will install apps for these features and slow their phones down and then blame samsung for building slow phones. Hope samsung is listening to this for their own sake.\\n\", '\\n  Overall good product from Samsung at cheapest price.For me Samsung is most trusted brand from 2004 untill now.Most impressive part of this phone is it\\'s huge two-three days battery backup.And most attractive S-Amoled display.Great sound quality (better than my old galaxy on8)Clean UI6 GB OF RAM128 GB OF ROMBlue colour looks awesome.And a faster processing unit for gaming and multitasking.At last not the least \"Made in India\"Love u Samsung India\\n', \"\\n  SAMSUNG GALAXY M21(4/64).Design - Subjective(I liked it).Build - Sturdy (but using back case and tempered glass suggested)Battery - 6000Mah around 2 days of battery life and charge time is around 2hrs 30mins if 10% battery left.Camera - Shots are well captured and image processing is good. End result is appreciable.Screen Quality - It's Samsung, need not worry about display. Good colour reproduction in SAMOLED. Nice touch response.Processor - Exynos 9611, this is pretty capable of handling almost every task u throw at it. But don't expect heavy gaming like Snapdragon 800 series. Exynos 9611 is similar to Snapdragon 730.OS - Snappy and didn't face any lags.Network reception - Didn't face any issue with BSNL, Wifi..etc.Audio output - Loud enough in the budget range(around 17k).I would suggest this phone if ur requirement is basic to medium likeWhatsApp, instagram, Facebook, YouTube, entertainment, medium gaming.\\n\", '\\n  Call quality: The phone serves best as a phone. Excellent sound quality and call quality and handoff over VOWIFI and VOLTE. The person can hear my voice clear as well.Didplay: Feels premium while holding the phone, however not so while looking at it from the back side.Networking: The only catch is the network speed. While other phones connect with 150mbps link speed to my  wifi router this phone connects to 2.4Ghz band at max 72mbps and 5Ghz band at around 400mbps. While tested on 2.4Ghz band, the network speed drops compared to my Huawei devices. On 60mbps connection I am getting 30mbps max while on the Huawei device I am getting 56mbps max. Although call quality is good, network signal strength drops to -80dBm compared to Huawei Honor 6x device @ -60dbm. 4G speed on LTE is also below the Huawei device. Getting 4mbps downlink on this device compared to 15mbps downlink on the huawei device. Wifi signal also drops very often and refuses to connect to the router. Then I have to turn the wifi off and on to be able to connect back. This makes this phone unusable.\\n', \"\\n  The youtube itself doesn't have 720p,1080p,4k resolution option, also camera quality is very poor. My old phone which had 12 MP pics were betterthe display was better for my old samsung phone itself ,Very bad. Display is not Good, quality is not good even pictures aren't good. Worst experience. Very disappointed with the product. A lot of people have put this phone in olx I thought there was some mistake but the product is not at all good don't go for it and waste it time.Overall Display  and Camera is not upto the mark as mentioned in features.\\n\", \"\\n  It's good phone in this range. I am overall satisfied with performance, mentioning some pros and cons for other buyers.Pros- Awesome Camera- Non-Chinese- Samsung Brand- Pre-Installed AppsCons- Battery is not what they claim, my last phone was Asus Maxphone with 5000 mah. Here they claim 6000 mah but it is not giving same backup as 5000 Mah battery phone was giving when it was new.- Touch is not that smooth- Casting (Playing on  my Smart TV) is difficult, you cannot do casting when your hotspot is on.- Speed of data is also slow, same sim giving better signal and data speed in other phone as compared in M-21.\\n\", '\\n  After using all most 2wks. Here is my honest opinion.1. Battery does not look at all 6000MH2. If you use mobile for continous 2hr it will heat like anything.3. Touch screen is real slow.4. Though camera quality is ok type but not so impressive in this price segment.5. Taking screen shot is real headache...Overall..Dnt buy it guys..

I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.\\n\", \"\\n  Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.\\n\", '\\n  \\xa0This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived dead and I have to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. After technician report confirming that phone is dead they now asking me to go for a refund as product is no longer in stock.\\n', \"\\n  Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series. 'Single take' shot option really useless.People who r looking for camera please don't buy m31s.All the modes camers pictures are 95%blur mode.perfomance of mobile is not up to expectations.When turns into selife mode really shocked IS IT HD photo or Asian paints colored WALL.REALLY SHOCKED.THIS TIME SAMSUNG DISAPPOINTED.Videos display is also not so effective. Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.THANKS\\n\", '\\n  purchased the phone on very first day, delivered by amazon on the next day - excellent serviceabout phoneused it for 2 days and then screen blacked out and phone not workingtried many things as suggested by amazon tech team but its still not workingreplacement order placed but it shows 20 days to deliver next onenever expected this quality from samsung\\n', '\\n  Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider\\n', \"\\n  I am using this for last 2-3 days now.This is my review after actually using this pgone in all aspects.Pros -1.

Display is just Superfine even in direct sunlight it works Excellent.Touch is just Excellent.3. Phone looks really cool in hands.4. Smart pop up feature is also good to have.5. UI is good.6. Speaker sound is good.7. No issues in calls - No call drips using Airtel sim.Overall its very nice experience using this phone.I researched alot before burying this phone and i am happy that i made this choice.Cons -1. Battery doesn't look like 6000 MAH it typically gives 1.5 days backup with single charge which other phone alao gives with relatively less Mah Battery.I was hoping to get little more backup2. Processor  - Could have been better3  No back cover for phone as it is hard to find in a market\\n\", '\\n  An excellent device would not be an enough word to describe this phone.Got it through prime and Amazon delivered it before time once again delighted with wonderful service by Amazon and the device is a masterpiece.Loaded with awesome features like 1 click camera, 6000mah battery, reverse charging, bigger and butter smooth super amoled display.Samsung has started to capture the Indian market and that ultimately allow us as customers to get rid of data stealer and spy Chinese phones.You can definitely go for this phone blindly\\n', \"\\n  Don't buy anyone worst product, Waste of money rs 18000.

Placed the order by 00:04 of 6th August (Day-1 of the sale) and got it very next day Noon 2pm itself. Kudos Amazon India.Grabbed it for 15,999 with a 2k coupon code and HDFC\\'s 10% discount.But, ordered a Matte Back cover and Matte Temper glass (As it didn\\'t come with the box and also wasn\\'t available near me in Chennai). Delivery date is 18th to 25th Aug which is pathetic. I have to take care my SaM31s like a baby.Small review as per my knowledge -On-hand, its so good. (Earlier was using OnePlus 6) Size wise bit bigger that 1+6 (6.5\")Comparing to Nord, we have Memory card slot - no dependency.While updating the phone on first start, i felt bit heat. But later, it was fine.Charged a 100% and had an extensive usage (not a gamer). Battery lasts more than 36hrs (with Bluetooth earphone at times).Charging happened in 70-75 mins with intermediate usage in between.Earphone Jack available comparing to Nord, better than Bluetooth earphone which consumes charge and needs charge for earphones too.Settings - an ocean of settings, wonderful touch sensor and additional features for lock facilities.But, doesn\\'t have indicator on the front face (which shows if notifications are received)No option to find app usage statistics.Audio - Its so good with clear audio in all needs.Photo - Video : Excellent quality of photos and Videos even in a 3x Zoom. Front camera is bit down.Macro Mode is giving a great pic of Close shots.Has Slowmo, Super slowmo, Hyperlapse, Panaroma.AR zone is pure magical. Different features for Front cam and Back cam.Reverse charging facility is amazing. But the box doesn\\'t have USB - charge cable.Overall - M31s is a price worthy with sooo many options.EDIT : Corning Gorilla Glass 3 is fine,just on 10th day of my purchase, my phone fallen down with less than 1m height (slipped from hand) and display borken 💔Handle with care.\\n', \"\\n  This is my personal view n review.  I upgraded from ayear old Redmi note 7 pro to M31 s because i wanted a non Chinese phone & m31s promo claimed good camera  battery etc. After usage of a week, I am sure that this was a bad decision. This phone is overhyped n priced. 15k would have been the right price for it. Its camera is good but doesn't give you out of the world experience.  Battery is 6K but doesnt run even for 1.5 day under normal use. Plastic used on backcover is cheap, the Samsung chipset sucks, this phone should have come with snapdragon and in range of 15K. I am not liking to write this review but Samsung has disappointed again. Redmi or one plus phones are clear winners. I will return this phone.\\n\", '\\n  Upper portion of the phone is getting heated after using it for very short period.....and even when making a call for 2-3 minutes same thing is being experienced.....but lower portion of the phnoe seems fine...also called Amazon technical support to check about this....they checked my phone through servify app...told me all are ok....if anyone facing same thing....please let me know....is it a common issue?\\n', '\\n  Pros :1. Display -- Amazing Super Amoled2. Battery -- Huge 6000mAh3. Camera -- Great especially the Single Take feature4. Reverse Charging -- Excellent, you can use this phone as a power bank as the cable in box is type c to type c5. Charger -- 25W fast charging6. UI -- Very good and easy to operate7. Fingerprint scanner on side is very Fast8. Gradient look is nice...Cons :1. Chipset still Exynos 9611 (10nm). This could have  been better at this price range....Over all ...Great product....👍4.5 on 5\\n', \"\\n  Don't buy this Samsung M31s.Camera quality is bad.Overall waste of money.\\n\", '\\n  Phone is good but delivery boy cheated and then took 1400 extra to accept exchange my old phone\\n', '\\n  Not found charger, cable, u pin and manualOnly handset received in box\\n', \"\\n  I am writing this review after 3 days of moderate to heavy usage.Design: The design of the phone is stunning even though its made of glasstic. The back is a dust and fingerprint magnet. So suggest to use a case. 5/5.Battery: Monstrous. Lasted for a day after watching 2 movies, occasional checking of mails, light gaming and browsing social media. I still had 10% left. The highlight is of course reverse charging and the super fast charging support. Took around 100 to 120 mins to charge the phone completely from 0 to 100. 5/5.Camera: One of the best if not the best camera in this range. The Sony sensor does a great job in the imaging department with some intelli cam features. 4.5/5.Processor and UI: For the last 3 days, that I've been using this phone, UI was pretty smooth and with some bloatware. I am a stock android lover, so thankfully I was able to delete a few pre-installed apps and block the ads/app recommendations while setting up the phone. There are some cool features like smart pop up view which are really awesome. The processor was lag free and its performance was smooth. I don't want to comment on gaming as I am not a heavy gamer. Overall an great choice for day to day usage. 4.5/5.Display: No comments. Just 5/5.The only disappointment I had was there was no case provided in the box. Overall I would give 5/5 for this phone. Regarding the pricing, when I've compared it with the competitors for 6/128 gb variants there was a difference of 1k to 1500 which I felt was fine considering the Samsung brand and features offered.I would recommend this one if anyone is looking for a decent phone under 20k.\\n\", '\\n  Facial recognition is bad... Phone is lagging a lot... Not satisfied at alll.\\n', '\\n  Phone is heating and also camera is blurring when flash light is on. Worst camera ever.\\n', \"\\n  Though not a big samsung fan I purchased Samsung M31S immediately after India launch yesterday for 18K after HDFC discount for 6/128GB after waiting for nearly 2 months for Redmi note 9 pro max 6/128 which was at 17K then went to 18.5K due to tax and production issues coz of lockdown. It was impossible to buy in their weekly flash sales coz Redmi didn’t have enough stock.Out of frustration thought of buying Samsung M31 6/128 which was available at 16K then but the Exynos processor, old dewdrop front cam, rear fingerprint scanner and 15watt charger for 6K battery holded me back…My Lenovo P2 which I had purchased on launch day in Jan 2017 had speaker issues after 3.5 years of usage.. Service centre has closed down in my city and nowhere else speaker was available…but after Redmi stock issues and M31 shortcomings made me purchase speaker for P2 from amazon and still using the phone. Repaired a phone for the first time in my life. Lenovo P2 is most underrated phone. Best battery life ever. Even after 3.5 years I still get 9 to 10 hrs of screen time. Excellent.I have used samsung only once earlier….Note 3 Neo….gud phone intially but later started hanging and pathetic battery life…. So my main expectation after using Lenovo P2s huge 5100mah battery from 3.5 yrs was battery life as I am a heavy user though I never play games.Though M31s processor may not be great for gaming etc it’s gud for normal usage. All my other concerns of M31 were overcome by M31s like punch hole camera, side fingerprint, 25 w charger, attractive design with side frame etc. Also Sony IMX 682 sensor and new camera features were add on.Also in Amazon sale got it for just 500 more than M31 and 500 less than Redmi note 9 pro max during normal sale when I intended to buy 2 monthsago… (6/128 model)I had also considered Poco X2 coz of its camera but was put off by its 4500 mah battery. Many users had issues of battery drain also. But if I had purchased Redmi note 9 pro max, Poco X2 or even Motorola one fusion plus or Realme 6 I would have deeply missed my Lenovo P2s super amoled display…..All these chinese brand phones though have gud Snapdragon processors but have very poor IPS display which r no match to super amoled display. I have seen and compared few IPS display phones with family and friends with my Lenovo P2 super amoled display…..there is day and night difference….So if I had gone with Redmi note 9 pro max I would have missed super amoled display and sony sensor…in samsung m31s I will miss Snapdragon processor…btw my 3.5 yrs old Lenovo P2 is having Snapdragon 625….Its super power efficient and smooth for day today tasks and heavy multi tasking..never played any games though....hope Exynos processor will atleast match S625 if not more.I ordered it on 6th Aug around 12.15 am…. was delivered on 8th Aug…..first impression is very gud especially the camera… excellent super amoled display….even a lot better than my Lenovo P2 super amoled display….built quality is the best in M series with new stylish dual colours and also has a side frame….but can’t b compared to glass backs which r just awesome but very fragile in reality….. anyways how many of us use mobile without case…..so this shall not make any impact for potential buyers of M31S…......case is must for M31s coz back though looks like glass is plastic and will easily get scratches.Battery is also excellent....being a Lenovo P2 user for 3.5 yrs I think finally I got a gud successor for it. Can't really tell the battery screen on time coz I am installing my 100 plus apps and logging in. Today charged from 21% to 100% in 1.36 hrs....so from 0 to 100 it might take 1.55 hrs to max 2 hrs...huge important over M31 which had same battery but would take 2.45 hrs to fully charge.Fingerprint is gud….it's fast but u need to touch it correctly….but I am getting used to side mounted fingerprint…it will take some time as I had front (below the display) fingerprint in my Lenovo P2.Rear camera is excellent. I am still checking out its features. Intelli cam with single take is quite interesting and helpful during important private moments.Indoor selfies r excellent provided there is enough artificial light…. without much light it’s avg like any other mid range phone….if we use front flash (white screen) when lighting is less then photo come very sharp and gud but with little boosted colours like wat normally redmi and realme back cameras do….I am not a gamer…..for normal apps and multi tasking there is no delay at all….hope in long run it remains the same…I am still little doubtful abt Exynos processor after few months….but this processor is tried and tested by samsung in many phones so hoping for the best…\\n\", '\\n  Not happy with this phone, apps are getting closed automatically wifi and mobile data connectivity issues are also there will see two more days else place the replacement or refund request\\n', '\\n  Liked almost everything about the phone. Except video / movies in dark light where images become pixelated. One more thing is lag in apps such as Smule for instance...Edit 1: after 5 days usage- Without a proper back cover, it is very slippery- Due to the massive battery size, the phone is on the heavier side- Some Apps are not having the proper aspect ratio due to the new dimension of the phone- The screenshot option is very inconvenient as compared to my previous phone, Xiaomi Note 4, that one was so easy to use!- I shifted to this non-Chinese phone (of course when the chance came) & expected it to be better but Chinese phones are surely VFM!- The processor is a huge let down! Seems that the RAM is unable to cope up with the lack of processing speed in this phone- The Camera is good yet using the same will take some more time for a Samsung non-userSome more updates in Edit 2!!!\\n', '\\n  Wrost apps. This is built in favor of Amazon. My phone is getting much more heating. Even in cold weather like ac room during a call also. But this worst apps tested and certified ok.THINK MILLION TIMES BEFORE YOU PURCHASE A PHONE FROM AMAZON SITE.NOW I AM GOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT ON CONSUMER FORUM AS PER NEW GUIDELINES OF CONSUMER......\\n', \"\\n  There is too much problem in this phone.1.  6000Mah battery but phone doesn't work even half day on standby mode.2.  In 64MegaPixel camera quality is too bad as per expactation.3.  Not working properly any sensor in phone (Face & Fingerprint).4.  It's too much time taken to charge the full battery approx more than 6hrs.Please don't buy this worst phone.\\n\", '\\n  Very nice phone. I am normal mobile user.. No games.. Just msgs and calls.Used it for couple of days.Below are the points.Pros1. Best display.2. Side finger scanner is fast.3. Good battery life.4. Very good camera for day and Night.5. Feels lightweight and grip is good in hand.CONS1. PLASTIC BODY.2. Quality of Charging cable is ordinary.3. Samsung should have included screen guard and body cover at this price.\\n', \"\\n  My phone is dead after 10 hrs. I'm wait technical visit..........\\n\", '\\n  Cons:Button position (power& volume) too highThough the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast.A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left.Width is less, height is more.The width is less than my MotoG5s+ and hence it disturbs viewing experience e.g. when viewing a YouTube video in a vertical manner.Pros:The fingerprint reader integrated to the power button is nice (touch to open, press down to lock)Does not feel too heavyNice display.The camera is decent.25W charger better than 15W of the M31\\n', \"\\n  good product under budget. Got it for 18K in Amazon sale.Phone is not heavy weight though it has big battery.Excellent display with L1 support.Super fast charger.Good camerasSide finger print sensor is very good.Stylish gradient design.Few things I personally didn't like:Build quality - seems very fragile.Too much of pre installed software by Samsung.No back cover included in the box.Phone looks very long (depends on personal choice).I am not a gamer.All in all best budget SUPER AMOLED mobile in this price range.\\n\", '\\n  Two issues detected :1. There is a considerable voice fluctuation in the RECEIVER of the device. While talking on call, the voice of person on another end fluctuates (decrease & increase frequently).2. The Single Take camera feature is not working properly. When I capture from Single Take, it only gives 3 videos but not the 7 photos along with that (which, it is not meant for).One could ignore the non working of camera feature once, but RECEIVER related issue can not be overlooked.When any new model is launched in the market, it is recommended to wait atleast 1-1.5 months from buying it, so that the detected bugs would be fixed by the company in the devices manufactured afterwards.I made a mistake, hope it helps others.\\n', \"\\n  You got for what you paidPros:1. Excellent display & Camera2. Better sound output3. Battery4. Support for Widevine l1 (For streaming Full HD contents of Netflix,  Amazon Prime, etc)5. Glastic back6. Headphone JackCons:1. Lots of bloatware (Even if you choose to skip while setup, it will eventually install later on)2. No NFC3. Little heatup issues then and there4. No phone case or Screen guard provided5. Year old processor which may slowdown with updatesI haven't tried any games yet. So cannot comment on the processor's maximum capability.At 19k, this phone really worth for its Camera & Display\\n\", \"\\n  I m not sure to call this a budget phone or a mid range phone. But worth the cost. Got it delivered as promised and seems to have good battery life. It's the 2nd day, I still have got 50% after watching few movies. If you have craze for the features and don't have money to buy a high end phone, then 31s is a better choice. The product is a little bulky than my MiA1. The display is just at it's best. Amoled. Phone doesn't seem to heat. But charging isn't in 97 mins as said. I find it to be around 110-120 mins just like normal phones. But the battery discharge is quite good. Found stock android to be a little flexible comparatively. But not to complaint. Overall it's one of the best phones I have ever had. Phone supports dual SIM + SD Card. Really Quality phone Made in India.\\n\", '\\n  I ordered M31s twice as first time cameras were defective and didnt work at all. I had to call amazon 5-6 times in the whole process to replace the product. But amazon refunded my money instead of replacement. Disappointed with amazon service and samsung quality.I ordered it again second time by paying additional Rs. 1500 as earlier it was in offer (SBI Card).Honest rating:Battery 5*Display quality 5*Performance/Speed 2* Very slow processor anf it hangs even playing youtube videos.Camera 1*Its main highlighting feature is cameras which perform totally opposite from its too much hype. The captured image pixels gets distorted even on slight zoom. Very poor cameras. Even a 16 mp camera performs better than its 64 mp intellicam. Selfie camera is also not good. Highly overpriced phone with poor cameras. Worst phone in this price range.\\n', '\\n  Looks wise it rocks.Dispaly is amazing.. Touch is also smooth.. Totally First impression awesome ...But i got a defective piece... NO FLASH IN THE MOBILE I GOT... being big brand how samsung will do these mistakes..Horrible experience..\\n', '\\n  Waste of money.. Overrated phone.. Haptic feedback is missing.. Poor camera quality.. Without secure foldar. Knox..\\n', '\\n  Phone is not working as expected its very slow and even I am getting frequent  error \"System UI is not responding\"I need to return this set and will purchase some other phone maker set but Amazon is not allowing me to do that and its seems very difficult  to contact Amazon  customer care in this COVID time.This is my worst experience  with any phone I have used till date.\\n', \"\\n  NO 4G Network mode option available to set the mobile network for 4G connection. Only 3G/LTE option exist screen shot attached. This is the most basic setting shockingly missing.My Vodafone 4G SIM works good in my other OPPO F3 mobile after setting network mode as 4G.If I didn't get solution either from  Amazon or Samsung, I will return this mobile.\\n\", \"\\n  Awesome camera qualityPowerful batteryNice build qualityExynos 9611 is not bad, I mean trust me if you are a working person an average mobile user, you won't feel any issue with this processor.If you are looking for non Chinese brand, you can choose this phone blindly.If you compare with price this phone is much better than One Plus Nord. I am not even going to comparing this phone with cheap and disgusting Redmi, Oppo, Vivo etc. phones.\\n\", \"\\n  The first Best part is wifi calling. Now you don't have to run to your balcony to catch some signals if you have a wifi connection.Second best part is that it has a very beautiful tag line - Made In India!Battery is literally a monster. No matter how heavy user you are. It will long last atleast a full day. For me it is 1.5 days.Screen quality is better than my iphone 7. Thanks to SAMOLED.Camera quality is again better than iphone 7. Thanks to 4 cameras.Processor is mediocre. Nothing great to boast about it. With this respect iphone 7 was smoother.Android vs IOS... once again ios is lot better than android.Overall happy with Samsung M31s4.5 out of 5 stars\\n\", \"\\n  this is worst experience m facing ryt nw, this device start getting  heat even after taking a call for 5 min., and also app doesn't operate properly device os hanging and legging can also be seen. This starts after 2 days and now amazon is saying thjs is normal heating issue and they are not giving me replacement or refund for this device..so guys take care of this before buy this device.\\n\", '\\n  All in all the mobile is very good. Especially the display is tremendous in this price segment,but there is an issue of heating on this mobile. Mobile gets hot after 10 minutes of use. I want to know from the Manufacturer that can it be fixed in software update!!??\\n', \"\\n  This is just an amazing phone. The camera is really good, Samsung's OneUI is feature rich, but the display and battery are the real MVPs here. For such a huge battery, the phone doesn't feel that heavy, lighter than phones within this price range.But that's because they use glass, and Samsung uses a material which is basically plastic, and to be honest, I would pick plastic over glass anyday. Glass is glass and glass breaks. Besides there is no point in having a glass back if it doesn't have wireless charging as well right?Speaking about the camera, it is very similar to any mid-ranger, but the highlight I would say is Single Take. It is not only just fun to use, but is very helpful as well. I didn't expect to like it this much. It is amazing.Now the display, it's huge. And it's vibrant. It's just a pleasure to look at. Sure it may be 60Hz, but the sAMOLED panel is a cut above the rest.And the 6000mAh battery is coupled with a 25W fast charger, which charged the phone reasonably fast, about 80 minutes from 10% to 98%. This is definitely a two-day phone as I am a mid-weight user, primarily media consumption.The one glaring issue: THE PROCESSOR, and in extension the GPU. It is noticeably inferior to Snapdragon 720g, 730g and the 730 which you can find in phones of similar price range. The difference is not that apparent in daily usage, but I'm sure it will impact a lot if you scroll through media a lot, or if you game a lot. So if you're a gamer, I would suggest a Chinese OEM, they have better hardware for the price.In conclusion, if you are a media consumer who also uses the camera a lot, buy this phone without a doubt. If you are anything more - a gamer, a person who wants to future-proof their phone etc.. I would look elsewhere.I love this phone as this fits my usage perfectly.\\n\", '\\n  Honestly I rarely review on products. I expected a lot from Samsung Galaxy m series particularly from m31s. I purchased one m21 for my father, m31 for sister and m31s for my self on exchange of Oppo f9. I was very happy when I received m31s. But disappointed about the poor packaging. Still I manage my anxiety to taste the set. The handset is having absolute premium looks. Again the picture quality of captured photos disappointed me. Battery is unable to give feelings of 6000mah. Its like less than 4000mah. Network is comparatively weak. Followed the procedure for replacement. The technician asked to install Blancco app to run diagnostic. Then he asked me to go for battery calibration test which is a one day process. Again followed the process of replacement. The technician checked all things and at last told me that the replacement may not be possible for this m31s rather adviced me to go for refund process. The foolish technician rarely knew the process of exchange purchase. On my second attempt of replacement process I came to know that, the first technician registered my complain as the problem is in m21. How foolish. I have compared my m31s with another m31s purchased by my neighbor where I found my set as weaker one. IF REPLACEMENT DONE IN NEAR FUTURE BY AMAZON I WILL BE SATISFIED AND RATE IT AS 5STAR OTHERWISE I WILL WITHDRAW MY PRIME MEMBERSHIP AND CLOSE ALL RELATIONSHIPS WITH AMAZON.\\n', \"\\n  Firstly I am giving 1star because of its processor I think samsung must upgrade Exynos processor.... And after 2 days use the phone heat too much and battery drained very fastPros..1. Best camera and camera features specially singal take2. Best battery 6000 mah with reverse charging and 25 watt fast charging3. SAmoled Display one of the best display you can say ...Cons...1. Processor It's not so bad but you can say old one..2. I feel some network connectivity issu in my airtel3. Build quality- It is not bad but if the use glass body then it could be much better4. Overpriced 1.5k or 2k5. Heating issue6. Battery draining issue7. It take 3 hours to full charge\\n\", '\\n  I bought this cellphone as my backup phone, within 8 days of usage there is sudden pigmentation around bottom left of the screen. Amazon shows that replacement was valid only till 16th Aug, 10 days from date of order but not from delivery.Since its a newly launched model service center is saying that they dont have spares. I am helpless now.\\n', '\\n  The phone is getting heat please don’t buy this ever\\n', \"\\n  I haven't words for M31S,  GREAT, I didn't like Chinese items.Thanks\\n\", '\\n  This phone has multiple  issues..1. Screen flickering issue in slow motion n in super slow motion..2. volume  controls not working while screen mirroring..3. severe heat while talking for few minutes... still my ears r burning 🔥\\n', '\\n  I have used various mobiles but Samsung is really a price saver and satusfier product Samsung m31 s is a best mobile I am reviewing features1. Camera quality awesome Sony made2. Screen is fully hd3.gamers are invited to purchase this awesome processor for games like pubg4. Reverse charging really amazed me5.battery backup is highIt has only one disadvantage it contains plastic body that I do not like on this and finally I reached to conclusion mobile is really awesome 😊😊\\n', \"\\n  Samsung galaxy m31s is most anticipated mobile ever because of its unique mixture of A and M series mobile features. It's the 1st mobile in M series to provide many flagship features like single take, 25w fast charging, infinity O display and even  it is secured by knox.Pros:1.Big battery and it's quite good with 1 and half day use. A light user definately gets 2 complete.days.2. Camera is also pretty good with more flagship features bundled in it.3. Display is an advantage in any samsung mobile. It does pretty well and looking very much premium.4. Loud speaker. Samsung doesn't teased about it but sound quality is really satisfying.5. Knox security is available but may be with limited functions. I haven't seen secured folder or nfc which are still differentiating it with A series mobile.6. Experience is good. I'm not a gamer, so overall i haven't noticed any issues with UI, software or processor.7. Looks are really premium. Metallic finishing gave stunning look to the mobile but note that it comes with plastic body only.Cons:1. Although the charger is of 25W charger, it's taking 2hours to charge completely.. may be because of monster 6000mah battery.2. Side mounted fingerprint scanner. It's a con since i haven't used it before and it's bit difficult to use.3. Phone is slightly heavy but that's because of battery but weight balance is good.Finally, if you are a heavy user but not with heavy games and looking for a clean android experience other than MIUI , colour os etc which will have adware in the apps, this mobile is a perfect purchase for you.\\n\", \"\\n  I appreciate the camera quality of M31s.. the selfie camera has a quality as your rear camera and the night shots or shots in dark are much better. The rear camera has a nice focus though not able to take clear long distance shots (100mts) which are very far but shots within 20-30 meters are perfect.I was impressed by the performance and charging as well. I have a 6GB Ram as i'm not a gamer hence could not comment but else good battery life.\\n\", \"\\n  Here's an honest review after a week's usage. Please take the time to read the pros and cons of this device. I'll start with the pros first.Pros:• The Samsung display never disappoints, very good colors.• The device is pretty smooth to use, there's no lag whilst browsing and using multiple apps in the background.• Sound output is decent for this price range.Cons :• The battery life, its supposed to last atleast a day and a half with this 6k mah battery, but i get only 10 hours of battery life with a normal usage such as WhatsApp, YouTube, music and browsing.• Finger print scanner is not upto the mark, since it's narrow and thin button, it doesn't recognise the print sometimes. I have thick fingers and maybe its because of that.• Face unlock is pathetic, I sometimes think that it's scanning someone else's face at times. Most of the time it never recognises my face eventhough I've registered my face in a bright environment. During low light, forget about it.• Notifications bug, when I play a WhatsApp audio or voice note, it constantly notifies me which is annoying. And whilst riding and listening to music, if there's a notification in the BG, after every song it notifies me which is annoying eventhough I turned off notification reminder.• Camera quality is decent but not great like how they've advertised. Some low light shots are grainy and only in bright environments it can capture some good pics.• No screen recording and no notification lights, although this can downloaded from the play store, there's an app for it. But the whole point is this is an android phone and its the basic feature, my previous cheap Chinese Huawei phone had more features.Anyway, overall I wouldn't recommend this if you're just looking for the battery life because it'll disappoint you. I'm quite disappointed with this phone and I doubt if I'd go for Samsung again. Thanks for reading, good day.\\n\", '\\n  bought it on amazon prime day sale . phone looks are very premium. amoled display is amazing . the single take option in photos work perfectly and allows you to take multiple shots in one go. phone battery is also good and works for one and half day without charge on moderate use. overall premium phone at decent price.\\n', '\\n  \\xa0Samsung m31s heap reals very bad experiencewhen we use other than system appsScreen gets blinksWhile playing video the screen gets blinks that irritates us to use ...\\n', \"\\n  My issue:I purchased this mobile to play PubG or other games but play games on this mobile is now a dream because it's stucking during play and Amazon is not providing any return and replacement option while my return window is still open.Regarding Amazon service:This time amzon changed their policy, so only replacement option available, but you won't be able to replace it because if you are facing any issue then it's technical staff will not approve or accept it.Regarding Samsung:I tried samsun mobile device this time but this company haven't changed so far. They are showing super fast processor or ram but you won't be able to play any game like PubG or any other game, all games are stucking. I will not recommend samsung mobile, you can buy note 9 pro insted of these samsung mobiles.Conclusion before buying any product on Amazon please check they are providing return and replacement option, if they are providing only replacement option then Don't buy those products from Amazon because it's a trap.Don't waste your money on Amazon because they have proven that we should not buy any product online. Because after purchasing if you are facing any issue afterwords their support team will not help you to return it.Thia is just my review and chalanges that I'm facing with AmazonGod bless you guys.\\n\", \"\\n  I bought this phone only the reason it have a best camera. But after 5 days use i am not satisfied with this phone. Reasons:-1. Camera:  It's not up to the mark. In low light photo is very bad.photo looks blur. In night also camera not good. Only v can take good photo in evening. That time all phones give us better photos.No AI support in camera. And portrait mode is in not in one click, its also not perfect. Macro also not good.2. Battery: The 6000 battery feels like 4500mah battery. One day we can use.3. Processer: now I don't feel any lag,but all youtube videos we can see this processor is not good enough for this phone.4. There is no second space option, No IR remote and gallery doest have discover,album options like iphone and honor phone.5. No screen recording option and no network speed showing option.Pros:1. In single shot we can get many videos and photos.2. Great display & design3. Smooth touch & fast fingerprint sensor.\\n\", \"\\n  Don't go for this product. It's not upto the mark as mentioned in product description. Camera quality is not at all good and face unlock is very slow.  Also the phone refreshing rate is very slow.Also the Amazon team is not helping me with returning the product when i am trying to return this within 24hrs of delivery.Worst camera from SamsungWorst support from Amazon team\\n\", \"\\n  #Processor is the main drawback#Camera is super awesome in day light but struggles in low light conditions.# Finger print sensor accuracy is 60%## Phone is overpriced if we compare with other brands..## 9611 Exynos is a junk and my Redmi note 5 pro is performaning better than the 9611 chipset!#Screen is a treat for eyes undoubtedly.Charges in 97min. from 0-100% in switch off mode.Doesn't overheat at all.Sound is above average..Voice quality is good.Signal reception is goodAll should be neglected but aged and lagging processor is a thumbs down!!\\n\", '\\n  Phone was delivered without a sim ejector pin and outer case .There was no plastic packaging outside the box only a seal was present.\\n', \"\\n  Return boy not received this mobile he told me it not work but I'm already complete it not working\\n\", '\\n  Another excellent M series mobile from Samsung.  Look of the mobile is elegant. The Amoled screen is very much vibrant and better than the previously launched M30s . Also i felt that the screen size is slightly 2 mm larger than M30s. The front camera is placed slightly 2mm lower than the top edge, henceforth may hinder video viewing in the enlarged screen mode. The battery is a monster with 6000 mAh , so need not worry about charging for atleast 2 days with respect to the way I use. Also thanks to reverse charging facility that samsung introduced in this model. Any gadget that has c-port can be charged directly with the charging cable provided as the both ends of the charging cable are of c- port. I think this feature is only introduced by Samsung in the budget range of less than 20k . However for connecting to the laptop I may have to use the M30s charge cable.  Also there is no heating problem during charging. Also the charging time is approx one and half hour from zero to full charge, which i believe is decent for a battery with capacity of about 6000 mAh.The sound quality is great. The camera quality - primary 64MP and front - 32 MP are awesome. There is a flash available for front cam as well similar to retina flash on iPhone 7 plus. Depth ( similar to portrait mode in iPhone) and Macro modes ( useful for capturing smaller size objects) are decent though not excellent. I am yet to check wide angle mode of camera. Also I am yet to check the night mode shots. Also there are other special features like single click are easy to use . It will capture a bunch of photos and video from which the best and required ones can be chosen and rest can be deleted. There are other features like single video recording on front and back cam , smart selfie option which I am yet to explore and review the quality as I just received the mobile . Also I liked the concept of introduction of finger print on the power  button on the right side. The specification of processor, RAM and storage space are decent for the price paid. Also i believe that samsung is offering the mobiles at the decent spec at lesser price when compared to other premium brands like one plus, MI etc.,. Also thanks to Amazon for delivering the mobile within 5 days, i.e., a week earlier than the promised date as I see that the mobile is not available at the time of order placement, because of the demand. Earlier I bought 2 qty of M30s and I had a very good experience of using them as i never experienced any performance issues with them. Also the M series mobiles are quite sturdy. Now I believe that I will have a much better experience with M31s. Thanks to samsung for the continual launch of better quality mobiles at a very competitive price. Also the samsung galaxy eco system of apps and cloud are pretty decent . Also I have a good experience with the services of samsung incase of any damage to the mobile. Overall I am happy with the product and also with the services of samsung and Amazon.\\n', \"\\n  Lots and lots of heating problem is there in the upper part of the phone while calling or browsing. Because of this issue you can't  call without earphones. Camera is also not that good as mentioned. Battery is also draining too fast .\\n\", \"\\n  The screen of the phone was broken when we received it. On calling the customer service, they can't replace the product since it's out of stock so we filed for a refund. The pickup agent denied picking up the product saying he needs a confirmation email first. When we called the customer support we were told that the pickup guy reported that the imei was mismatched which is why he didn't pickup but in reality he didn't even check imei. Since then we filed for a pickup 4 times and nobody has shown up to pick it up. Pathetic behaviour by the Bhopal logistics team. The Amazon support talks very politely to us and assure us of pickup but then do nothing about it.\\n\", '\\n  i am writing about this product after one month use.*DISPLAYSamsung Super Amoled display is really amazing.* BATTERYBattery is 6000 mah,but actual performance is equal to 4500 mah of other brands.For me battery backup is 1 day.*build qualityi am impressed with build quality. i did not find any damage after 2-3 drops from table.*Camera QualityPicture quality is not good. Its worse than a 12 MP camera.* Back cover and earphoneBrand is charging 20000 rs, but they can not afford cost of back cover and earphone.This is worst .*Processorold and outdated processor. Phone is lag during gaming,even on small game like angry birds this will also lag.i will not suggest to anyone  to buy this phone at 20000.better to go for other brand.\\n', '\\n  My first ever Samsung phone...Feels like a premium phone when you hold it in your hand.Display is awesome. It is very bright even in outdoors.Weight of the phone is little bit more. But it didn\\'t feel heavy, because Samsung has done its weight balance in pretty good manner.Processor is good, didn\\'t feel any lag till now.Fingerprint scanner is a little bit slow. Sometimes it needs to press hard to scan.Camera quality is also good especially in daylight. But typical Super slow motion video(which I like most) is of limited duration.Battery last for 24-30 hrs for normal use (battery optimization could be better). The battery life can be improved by changing power mode in the setting.The 25W charger is also very good. And it is \"Made in India\".Samsung UI is also good.Samsung should have provided at least a case with this 20k phone. It is hard to find case in the market for a newly launched phone.Overall worth for the money. 4.5/5 star.Better than the Chinese phones.Do buy the Samsung phones instead of the cheap Chinese phones.\\n', '\\n  Worst mobile ever phone is heating too much I complain to the Amazon but they are not expecting my complain\\n', '\\n  A worst phone and worthless.Camera quality is poorTakes blurry shotsThere is no easy way to click slefies as phone length is more its hard to reach buttons. The palm sensor takes blurred selfies and delay in loading pictures.Any Chinese phone of 10k is much better than thisPerformance is not upto the mark as they claim. Fingerprint sensor takes time to unlock the phone. Hardly recognizes the face. Phone is not quick on opening app or anything.Width of the phone is less compare to other 6.5 inch phonesIts an absolute waste of money.This phone is worth of 8k and I have wasted my money in this worthless due to its hyped advertisement  and just to get rid of Chinese products\\n', \"\\n  I purchased this phone on 6th August, but still I can't use the phone. Only because tempered glass and back cover is not available. Come on samsung, I purchased because I didn't want to purchase oppo,pocco.. blah blah.... As I am supporting make in India product.. but these Chinese brand know the nerve of customer and providing basic accessories with the phone.. it would be better if i ordered Mi phones, they are providing basic accessories and the camera quality is better than your phone in this price range..\\n\", \"\\n  So here you'll get my honest opinion about samsung M31s👇I just got this phone.I ordered this phone on first launch day from amazon.Question 1:- What do i think about this phone in this range?Answer:- This phone in this range is quite good but if you're a samsung lover or you boycott chinese product and don't want to buy a chinese phone like mi,realme.You can go for it.Question2:- What do you think about specifications in this range?Answer:- Specification what i like most is Display quality,good battery backup,fast charging,good camera and process is still being tested so keep in touch on telegram @guptajitalks .Question 3 :- Should i purchase this phone in this range?Answer:- Umm i'll suggest you to go for it if you're a samsung lover and your priority is batter backup,fast charging,video watching,camera then please go for it but if in the past you've used realme,or mi phone then don't purchase it because you'll miss some of their feature which is not available in this phone you need to install extra applications for them from play store or other source.Question 4:- Should i purchase Samsung M31 or M31s??Answer:- If your main priority is fast charging and you want to use a new updated fingure print sensor you can go for it otherwise everything is similar in this phone.Choose according to your budget.Question5 :- Does fingure print work fine?Answer:- Fingure print senson is working awesome.I was also getting hesitate but now i am feeling relax because it's working fine and smooth.Question 6 :- Anything else if you want to ask then text me on telegram @guptajitalksAnswer:- Will be updated soon😊I want to mention something:-👇👇👇Note:- 1.Camera,charging,display,cable,Video watching experience is awesome.Processor is still being tested.2.You'll miss some feature if you previously used mi or realme phone.You need to install extra app for it.\\n\", \"\\n  After using 10 days:1. It's not look like 6000mah battery. Other brands phone in below 5000mah, can give more backup than this.2. Very bad wifi receiver. Not able to capture wifi signal properly. Same thing for reverse case means mobile hotspot. It's not able to transmit high range. Trust me if you think I am wrong, just make a comparison with you any old phone and see the difference.3. If both sim card are on, in 2nd sim you are getting call, after disconnecting call sometimes network is fluctuating. It's taking some time to stable.4. If you are dropping your phone to bed, some sound is coming. It seems sim tray is casing this noise.5. Lock or Finger print scanning button which is mounted in right side is making sound (tik tik) while pressing it. It's not smooth.Please check your phone and don't forget to add comments here wheather you are facing or not the same. I am waiting for all your inputs.\\n\", \"\\n  Lets talk about the positives first:Design & Build - Compelling for this Price range. Fingerprint Magnet - AlertDisplay - Damn, This is the best.Software Experience - This is not a clean UI but I like this feature that Samsung almost took customization to the next level.Camera - Decent, Sony sensors does its job and Samsung's camera features is like a cherry on top.Multimedia Experience - This is what the phone is good at. Believe me it wont disappoint you either.Battery - Humongous. and Fast Charger is in the box. No need to worry about the battery backup.Cons:-Not major but noticeable.Weight :- You ll definitely feel it when used for a long period of time.Performance - This is not so good as the competition provides for this price range. You can notice it heavily while scrolling Twitter.  But everything is usable. Just a little bit of boost to the performance would have taken this phone to the next level.Phone gets little bit warm which is also noticeable. ( I don't know if only I have that issue)Overall - (Gamer boy, Performance Addict) - Just Ignore thisPeople like me those who could sacrifice that little performance for a good multimedia experience should definitely give it a try. And that display, you ll definitely fall in love with it.\\n\", \"\\n  Amazing device under 20kIf you are a camera lover then believe me you won't be disappointed.I have purchased this device in first sale.

Samsung M31s 8GB 128GB is the best to buy product in around 20k with 6000mah battery & amoled display. Camera is far better than M31 as it used Sony sensor. Works like charm with no lag, beautiful display, good camera, easy too handle, not much of bloatware & many can be disabled/uninstalled of not needed.

Hope no one else is facing this issue.Need to replace my device!\\n', '\\n  I liked the camera on M31s and I think it\\'s the best camera on a phone under 20k. Apart from that samsung is making Chinese manufacturers sweat by slowly focusing on mid range mobile category so yeah we can expect great phones under low budget as well.  Only thing which I don\\'t liked about this device is Exynos 9611 as it is an old processor & shows its age while gaming. Apart from that everything is \"monster\" 😁.\\n', \"\\n  Item defective & wrost products don't buy\\n\", '\\n  Facial recognition is not working itself and Its says 64MB camera but its only in writings not in performance.6000 MAH battery but it will drain in 8hrs (Not even Continues) if you watch basic youtube and normal FB browsing. I will not recommend this mobile if anyone wish to by only for Camera and battery\\n', \"\\n  Phone functions are good but charging is slow not like as fast as advertised..  It took almost  one and half hour to reach out 75% from 20% like other handsets.. I don't find any speciality in fast charging or charger.\\n\", \"\\n  Very disappointed with Samsung and Amazon...Camera hangs and single shot mode doesn't works properly...Sometimes it gives only three outputs and sometimes 7...It never gives 10 outputs as claimed by brand...\\n\", \"\\n  Is this the best smartphone under 20,000/-Let's find outBattery:-This is the only reason why I bought this phone. So, I thought I will share my experience regarding the battery life of this phone first.I really use my phone.  I receive over a hundred phone calls per day and hundreds of WhatsApp message if not thousands. When I reach my phone I have an average of 50% juice left in the battery. So to say, I am pretty happy with the battery life on this phone.Camera:-This is another one of the main selling point on this phone.  This phone has quad camera setup at the back and an single punch hole display in the frontList of cameras at the back:-1. Primary camera - 64MP - Sony IMX6822. Ultra wide lens - 12MP - 123° field of view3. Macro lens - 5MP4. Live focus lens - 5MPPrimary camera takes beautiful crisp shots with excellent dynamic range provided ample amount of light. If doesn't disappoint me in night also! The ultra wide camera provides the same amount of color balance and dynamic range. The live focus provides good edge detection. So this is the most improved phone in the 'M' lineup of Samsung phones.Display:-This has a beautiful display with a dot nucth which doesn't interfere much. Therefore this has a good display tooFingerprint sensor:-This phone has a side mounted fingerprint sensor. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is excellent and I quite like it compares with my previous phones which has fingerprint sensor at the back, but one thing which disappoint me is that it won't work when you r hands have even the slightest amount of water or oil or any other thing.Conclusion:-This is not a perfect phone under 20,000/- but it is definitely one of the better phones for 20,000/-.\\n\", \"\\n  A perfect phone made by Samsung in mid range. Camera perfect, Body style perfect, Battery perfect  & much more. But a thing I don't understand that why Samsung made charger cable C to C, it would better if it comes with USB to C which helps us to connect it easily with many devices like powe bank,  Desktop and etc.And one more thing I like to suggest to Samsung that, it will be more better if Samsung gives a back cover with every smartphone because in market back covers are available after 3-4 weeks of phone launch & all of us know that it is how risky to use a smartphone without cover.\\n\", \"\\n  Faulty mobile phone received. To charge this phone, it takes around three hours to charge upto 65%, while operating the phone, charging indicator showing @5%.Spoke to amazon customer service about this issue. As per them technician assigned to inspect the phone. After technician's report they will replace the phone.\\n\", '\\n  Camera quality is great. SonyIMX sensor rocks. Night mode is awesome. Screen Display quality is a treat for eyes, brilliant sAMOLED. Battery is Monster.Only one issue of data transfer from laptop due to lack of USB cable. Mobile shipped with Type C to Type C cable for charger/reverse charger. Samsung should add flexible back cover and USB to C port cable in the box.Ad free UI. Simple and useful. And most important it is made in India. GO for it. Good choice over cheap unsafe Chinese items.\\n', '\\n  Awesome loaded by samsungI have upgraded from m30sDisplay was new feel with punch hole.Fingerprint and face unlock was faster.Felt good at camera aspect with stunning picture outcomeOnly disappointment is plastic backApart that everything was good and for a heavy user just blindly go with m31s\\n', '\\n  You do not have to check any of the specification just buy blindly, only think on it before buying if you  are a heavy GAMER because this phone is not for gaming purpose it is pure BUSINESS phone.\\n', \"\\n  Not happy with amazon service. Guys it is 20K+ Rs cellphone..the back cover is not fitted properly and it could damage display..In spite of having replacement policy amazon failed to provide replacement and providing refund..this is going to be painful experienceas I have exchanged my reliable Nokia as it was having less tech spec and I purchased this cellphone on EMI..this made situation slightlycomplicated. I am thinking to file a case against Amazon in consumer court..Samsung plz take care of your product quality..not expected from giant like you who is a big game changer and invest lot of money in R&D. Poor quality control and pre dispatch  inspection.I'd never buy Samsung  again.\\n\", '\\n  The mobile was delivered on Aug 12, much before it was showing earlier. I was using MiMax2, a Chinese product and was happy to use that and had decided to patronise Mi in future. But with current concept of avoiding Chinese products altogether, I ordered Samsung M31s. Initially, it looked to be smaller that Mi max2, though both having 6.5 display. But later on realised that M31s is a bit longer that Mi max2 thus both the phones have the same square cm area!The mobile is fantastic in everything. The finger sensor at the power key on the side is comfortable, so is the face recognition; I am enjoying it. I have set all three, pattern, finger sensor and face recognition for opening it. I could easily install dual WhatsApp. Two sims with external memory card is appreciable, with Volte in both sims always on. Camera should be good; I do not use it much.I could not find a system of locking/unlocking individual app through finger sensor, as I was having in mi max2, nor a shortcut for using torch when in haste. Yet happy for discarding a Chinese mobile and substituting with a good one, Samsung M31s. Go for it.\\n', \"\\n  Well this is my Jump from Galaxy J7 prime(2016) to this one.  It makes a big difference overall.But don't expect everything to be Premium, honestly speaking1. Camera is not like how it was hyped. It is decent and I was not expecting much from Samsung.2. Display is wonderful you will enjoy High end videos.3. Sound output is good.4. Battery I would like to say it took me exactly 1 hours 44 mins to charge from 0 to 100%. On the other hand it went from 100 to 96% In 23 mins while playing You tube music on Speaker it was connected through Wi-fi, no SIM connection and No any apps in background.5. Processor is fast.

It comes with 25 watt fast charger which completely charge it in approx. 80 mnts.I am giving this review after 20 days use. It is a value for money product.Its diary is amazing Also,it is made in India 🇮🇳. Much better than #REDMI NOTE 9 PRO MAX,#REALME 7 PRO#,POCO X2\\n', '\\n  Samsung M31s A best phone in this rangeFingerprint sensor is just amazingBatter lif e is a bit lesser than expectedCharging speed is amazingCamera quality is awesome\\n', \"\\n  Please don't purchase this phone via Amazon. These phones not pass by Samsung quality Department. So Iam sharing my experience.\\n\", '\\n  Much better than expected. The 6000 mAh battery and giant screen are the steal. The back finish looks premium as well.PROSgiant screen & battery25W fast chargingFingerprint unlock is super fastLooks premium & has the punch hole cameraSpeaker is really loud\\n', '\\n  Amazing phone in this price range.Camera and battery life is really good.Fast charging works well.PUBG runs smoothly, faced the framedrops sometimes .. but still satisfactory game play. (Not good for heavy gaming )Fingerprint reader aworks well, not too fast not too slow. Face unlock is not good.Screen and build quality is amazing, looks are better than the competition.\\n', '\\n  1. Battery drains quickly not like Samsung Galaxy M31s2. Overheating, due to this your apps in multi window will close3. Audio jack issue, if headphones are touched or moved the Music Player will open and Call gets disconnected.4. Many reviewers said that macro mode is good, but it is not like that. One must use this personally then can  review.\\n', \"\\n  It's been 3 days since I am using this phone.And it has been a premium experience since. I am not a gamer hence it's performance is great for normal use. As for a gamer the processor might fall short.Major pros:Stylish finishPremium screen experienceSuperb cameraMajestic battery (charged once in three days)To sum it up, it is a great catch for a normal user with premium features.\\n\", '\\n  Cons.1.When you zoom the clicked pic it gets distorted overall nice camera.2.Processor should be upgraded.3.On screen fingerprint should be given than the side.4. Slight width should be increased5. At least a case should be given for the protection of the phone.6. Not much difference between M31 & M31s.Pros.1.Samsung screen is always a good and indeed a infinity experiences.2.UI/UX is good on this one overall a stock Android experience no bloatware or extra + lastest Android version 10.3.Camera is 8.8/10 (from my view).4.Massive battery 6000mah + 25W fast charger5. Great storage6. Good brand not Chinese.\\n', '\\n  Phone is pretty much cool but bit heavy .I prefer if it will be more slim and light .The display is good and the camera is superb .Everything is good for me .Most impressive feature is super fast charging and most disappointing is that the battery is draining very fast and I have used it for only 5 days now .Very much disappointed with the overall battery 🔋 performance .It is no where in performance near to Redmi Phones ,Realme or One plus .I am now thinking that I have wasted my money coz it is not worthy for its rate ..What is surprising that there have been no original invoice in the package and its shocking to notice that .\\n', \"\\n  I got product today only.  Detailed review I will give later.Initial review under:Product is looking better than I expected.  Outer box is very cheap quality.  Screen resolution good but not best.  Camera quality good.  Soud quality motr than average.  It is taken more than 1 hour for 60% charging. Initially I feel it's a good phone but they could have atleast given back cover and ear phone with this price range.\\n\", \"\\n  I was looking for a new phone in the Samsung brand I must say galaxy M31s is the best choice, that too at such a reasonable price.I have been using this phone for over a week now and following are my  views on the phone.1. Delivery by Amazon just the next day of my purchase. Thanks Amazon!2. The size of the phone is quite appropriate,it stays in my pocket easily and can be used single handed. It has a metal like finish3. As far as the display is concerned, crisp and clear with infinity- O display, absolutely soothing to the eyes.4. Sound quality - It has a premium quality Dolby sound and I just love to hear music on this phone.5. The 1st best feature if this phone is it's battery with 6000 mAh. Even if I don't charge my battery lasts for at least 2 days. Also the charger is very fast.6. The 2nd best feature is the camera. It has 4 cameras having best depth and clarity of 64mp with ultra wide lens and macro camera. The clarity of the front camera is outstanding for selfies!I would strongly recommend this phone, you can't get anything better in this range..\\n\", \"\\n  Very nice and handy phone. Excellent camera, with very useful Single Take feature.Look of the phone is premium with the shaded back cover giving it a premium feel.Battery is good @ 6000mAh, enough to last a full day easilyScreen resolution is the best feature of Samsung phone, and this one also doesn't disappoint.Overall a very good buy at this price... Highly recommended\\n\", '\\n  For the first time when I turned the device on out of the box, the device was named as Kamal\\'s Galaxy M31s. Now I dont know who that kamal is!!  Can any one tell me why it is named as Kamals and who that kamal is?  Themes also show as \" Themes recommended for kamal\".  This makes me feel like the device has been used by somebody else before and then remanufactured it and sent it to me.Device manufacturing is of very poor quality (not the mobile phone).  Looking at the box and its packaging, it does not look premium quality.  In fact, the package feels very cheap.  There was no back cover and screen guard provided at all in the box.  This definitely feels like it is manufactured by some local people not by the company like Samsung.  M series being specifically manufactured for India.  This shows how cheap the company sees at the Indians to give this kind of worst packaging and quality.  You can even check the printing on the sticker attached at the back of the mobile with imei numbers.  How cheap quality printing it was. (Check out the images. I even attached photos of my redmi box and u will make out the difference).Mobile phone definitely hangs sometimes.  I faced hanging issue while closing telegram app.  I also faced abrupt closure of apps in the middle on its own while installing all the necessary apps in the mobile.Camera wise, rear camera is good, but front camera is not up to the mark.  In low light conditions there is definitely a lot of noise in the photos taken with front camera.Display wise, it is Excellent being a superamoled display. However, they should have given 90Hz refresh rate for the price of mobile.I am not a gaming person so I dont know about gaming performance in this phone.I had high expectations  on this phone and purchased it with a huge excitement and enthusiasm, but this mobile does not meet the expectations and it disappointed me a little bit.I am somewhat a lover of samsung products especially display related products like mobiles and TV.  But, this time I am little disappointed with cheap manufacturing of the product.  Then again, display quality is very good. Other than that, rest of the things really disappointed me in this phone.\\n', '\\n  Display is best in this segment. Its bright punchier colorsand great outdoor visibility. Deep blacks is perfect for movies. Sometimes i Miss high refresh rate screens but its ok to have such beautiful Amoled display.Camera is better now. Single take mode is fun to use. Night mode is now better than M31 and the best part is pro mode is back with shutter speed control. 4k front video is useful for bloggers like us. Selfie is good. The only thing i missed is telephoto camera. Syper steady is amazing.The exynos 7611 handles the phone quite well. But samsung should upgrade this to snapdragon or better processor made by samsung. UI is best much better than other phones. Its lag free and smooth. Everyday use is best on thisBattery is best best and best lasts more than 2 days with normal use and one day with heavy use. Screen on time is around 9 hours. And the best part is it has the same charger with Samsung provide with s20 series. So i can use my s20ultra with the same charger.Overall i can say its best in this segment if you dont need high refresh rate display but you want best battery life and beautiful vibrant display with better color accuracy then go for it\\n', \"\\n  Overall this is a phone for non gamers, camera lovers and for media consumption. It has been a mixed reaction with 15 days usage. More details below. Thank you for reading.Pros;Display: 10/10 nothing more to say.Camera:Back cameras are really good with all four of them being useful in different conditions. Apart from the 64MP primary sony sensor the 12MP wide angle and 5MP macro sensor give good quality pics and not there as a gimmick.Front camera is a mixed bag. Under slightly low lighting conditions it doesnt produce great pics and is bit grainy. Samsung please fix this with an update. But if you put the screen flash details are good.Colors are saturated which some will like and others may hate.Network Reception and data:So far so good. However, it is not the fastest w.r.t data download speeds under this price category. It depends on the modem that has been used.Battery: At first the 6000mah battery seemed like a 4000mah w.r.t performance showing battery drain issues. You need to check the device health statistics to determine the culprits. If you have turned on adaptive brightness (auto brightness) then battery consumption will be high. Since smasung uses the front camera for auto brightness. I would suggest you to turn it off. Secondly add apps which you don't use frequently to sleep and deep sleep under battery optimization. Also switch on the adaptive battery optimization. After all this now it finally lasts longer in the range of 40 - 44 hours in a single charge. Again it can vary based on your usage. But these steps will definitely increase your battery life per charge.Cons:Processor: Samsung please use a nice processor in such a good mid range smartphone. This is a downer. Almost everything else is good. Gamers please stay away from this phone. Day to day task are fluid but still you may notice occasional lags while opening some apps and animationsGlasstic Back: If you use a cover on your phone this may not be a concern. However, people who like the phone as is...may not be able to use it without worrying about a scratch.Weight of phone: Along with a good cover this phone can build your biceps. You can feel the weight.Overall people who use a phone for connecting, productivity, social media, vlogging and media consumption then this is a good one. Gamers will hate this for sure.\\n\", \"\\n  I ordered the phone as soon as it went on sale, i.e on the midnight of August 6. I was unaware that it would only be available to prime users so I had to first subscribe to Amazon prime, and during this process the blue variant of the phone that I wanted to buy went out of stock. Nonetheless, I managed to order the mirage black 6gb variant which was the only one available at around 12:25 am.But yeah I would say that I'm not at all unsatisfied with the black one as it looks so stunning. The phone was delivered to me on the morning of August 9, that is pretty fast.It has been 2 days since I'm using the phone and I would say that there is a lot about the phone to boast. I'm so happy to have been able to buy this.Everything about this phone is so awesome but the two outstanding features of this phone are its premium looks and the rear camera. The rear camera captures stunning images in all light conditions and the quality of videos is also amazing. I really loved the single shot feature, its fun to use. One thing that I'm a little bit disappointed with is the performance of the front camera in low light. The sAmoled display is so cool, you won't face any problem operating your phone in the sunlight.The 25W charger is quite useful as it charges the phone at a blazing speed. The 6000 mAh battery lasts longs but I haven't tried extreme gaming yet.So guys just go for it! Nothing can be better than the Samsung Galaxy M31s at this price range.\\n\", '\\n  This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived with an irresponsive touch screen and I had to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. Even showed it to the Samsung customer care center.  After the technician report confirming that the phone is a defect piece, the only option available was to place it for a refund as it is no longer in stock.\\n', '\\n  I ordered this Samsung galaxy m 31s model.but the charger was missing and camera quality is so cheap..very bad experience.i want to return the product.but they said only replacement of same phone can be done..plz gv me some option to return this item or I can replace with other good phone atleast having good camera quality.my phone screen was damaged.but phone charging is fast and good battery 🔋 backup..\\n', '\\n  Good Phone for the price being a Samsung phonePros -A fantastic display, extremely colour acurate, vibrant, with great sunlight visibilityGood build quality, thought its plastc but looks gorgeousOne of the best camera performer around this price range here I am very specific because I am a photographer by professionInspite being a 6000 mah battery does not feel that hafty & well balenced to holdHeadphone sound output is best in class also the speakers, Media consumption on this phone is a fantastic experience.One UI is better then ever on a Samsung phone now, extremely stable & smooth nowCons -The processor is not that powerful at all, despite being the 8gb varient that I bought shows lag & stutter around the UI every now & then on heavy multitasking usage, high end gaming is also not a smooth experienceThe 6000mah battery sounds much but it doesn\\'t last more then 1 day battery drains so quickly on this phone ( hopefully will be fixed by futer updates )The wifi hotspot only supports 5ghz band its not a duel band one on this phone so if u have a laptop or PC with 2.4 ghz wifi adapter, you won\\'t be able to access the hotspot from this phone, I had to purchase a 5ghz wifi adaptor for my PCOne UI core version on this phone lacks so many features that we found on A series phone so thats a compromise on this phone specially I miss the lack of led notification on this phoneThe Camera to API on this phone does not support Google CameraOn the Camera department , it does not support 50/60 fps1080p, its only limited to 30fps thats a downside for me specificallyPhone does not support some graphic intense apps like .. Adobe Premiere rush, & few moreGorrila glass 3 is not that grat in terms of display protection, so installing a screen guard is a must, also the back is very proan to scratchesThe figer print sensor is good but not that fast like Xiaomi phones, also the face unlock misses so many times but thats also subjected to be fixed by updates.Overall its a good \"Samsung Phone\" if you dont run much graphic intence games or apps\\n', \"\\n  On first day.itself.  ..Phone is not getting charged after long hours of charging...And that too from Amazon and Samsung brandReplacement process initiated...But its very very bad experience and not expected from such reputed brandsNow who is responsible for this delay and at what cost band why we should sufferThird class quality control from Amazon and SamsungHope they karna lesson from this...Even though they might have millions of customer's..But bad lesson. ..Remains bad for ever\\n\", \"\\n  I've been using this phone for 2 weeks, extremely happy about the batery backup, fingerprint reader is really cool & impressive.About the camera quality it's been amazing.Apps opens faster and also multitasking is efficient. Really liked the always on display feature and dark mode. Also sound quality is awesome, & with headphones amazing experience as it provides Dolby Atmos feature while using headphones gets activated & you can enjoy the theatre like experience. Also very light weight considering the battery capacity, very easy to operate with one hand & touch sensitivity is also amazing even with screen gaurd. Battery gets charged from 10 to 100 in two hrs. Now no need to carry any power bank.\\n\", '\\n  This is my worst experience with amazon that too over samsung.I got the mobile delivered on 20th Aug.Packaging was good.I opened the box overall style is good in view.But when i switched on the phone,it directly opens up in safe mode after restarting also it was in that mode only.Again down volume key button was not working at all.Then I find the phone detecting sim without sim card only.The phone was generating more heat as compared .I called to amazon tech support ,I followed all the instruction according to them still there is no change.I requested for replacement where I saw in my page phone is in stock but they denied for replacement and just the option was refund.\\n', '\\n  This is next level of M31, looks premium. I brought M31 for wife and now I purchased this. After comparing both....Cemera is of next level...Infinity O display looks premium, Side finger sensor feels cool...and finally mobile looks and feel very premium...Just simply go for this.\\n', '\\n  while placing an order i was thinking about better SD chip-set phones ...but after seeing this mobile ....there is no difference performance ...Exynos does Better than expected coz OS is build accordingly....camera & Display =10/10battery=10/10side mounted fingerprint=8/10 (its the only thing not 10/10)feel in hand=10/10 ( premium...feels like 40K device..)social media and  heavy games (except Chinese games (#BoycottChina)),heavy web browsing=10/10!!\\n', '\\n  everything  thing is amazing  especially  battery life and finger scanner and display  is incredible  especially  punch hole camera  on front  side ....... wProcessor is also  good gor basic use it works really  well ..... all sensors nare there and amazing  features  also .....

But first impressions last for long and M31s doesn't disappoint on the contrary it puts a smile on your face !!PS - Disappointed not to get out of the box back cover even for this price segment, had to run from shop to shop to find one as its a new phone in the market, was hard to get one but got it eventually.\\n\", '\\n  Battery life is not as per expectation with minimal use only 40% got discharged.Camera quality is better but best. Even Single take feature also not that much impressive, because it not give 10 pics always as per provided information of this feature (or else i dont how to use this feature, if i am doing anything wrong then pls let me know. If any configuration is required to use this feature pls let me know).Not given option of Microsoft office link, so i cant connect my laptop with phone.This is the review after one day use.Over all good.\\n', \"\\n  A major drawback which I found; when I'm on voice call, I can't connect to the internet...means you cannot send a photo on whattsapp while on voice call or cannot open chrome to check something...this was a major drawback on my previous phone also...but with today's advancement and latest phone, I did not expected this.....Being a businessman, very often I need to send photos on whatssapp while on call to discuss details at the same time....NOT POSSIBLE on Samsung M31s....rest all things are good at this price.\\n\", \"\\n  Please do not buy Samsung Galaxy M31s model, I bought this model phone through Amazon on 8th August 2020 during lauching fest. Got delivery on 15th August, started using on18th August, today is 36th day, morning as usual I took the phone to switch on wifi to use, screen came on the all of a sudden screen gone total black out, booked service center through samsung toll free number, visted they couldn't do anything much, infact they returned my phone with sreen lights on, they cant do much only requested me to change mother board. I want Amazon to replace with a new phone. I am not willing to use a phone with this sort manufacture deffect.\\n\", '\\n  I am using the Galaxy M31s for a few days now. I will note the pros and cons as I have observed so far.Pros:1. The display is excellent. Vivid colors that pop, good contrast and definition.2. The touch response is butter smooth. I think it is at par with an iPhone.3. No lag, no heating issues, no screen problems so far.4. Battery life is very good.Cons:1. There is a huge amount of bloatware. I uninstalled most of them, but some cannot be uninstalled. I disabled or forced stopped them. I deleted 1 star because of bloatware.2. The side mounted finger print sensor is not very convenient. They should have given a normal real mounted FP, which is easier to use. I deducted another star because of side mounted FP.3. The face recognition feature does not work all the time, but that is a common issue across many other phones.\\n', '\\n  Have a phone now with me... over all it is good non chinese and clean UI. I am chinese user earlier switch to samsung this time. Being a normal user it is ok with current processor (youtubers saying processor bla bla bla).Only giving 3 star rating cause no screen guard and case is provided in the box. Which is still not availble in market as well.When you got the box... i observed box quality is quite low as comoare to other brands however no problem..this is ignorable..every companies looking for cost cutting.Phone is good if you are normal user watching media and social networking sites and small gamers.Gamers definitely need to go with realme, mi, other brands having high antunu scores\\n', \"\\n  Things i like ::Excellent Display QualityWatched HD videos on Youtube/Netflix and it was just awesomeThe camera quality and software both are goodOne UI is certainly among the top UIs in android world after Oxygen OSBattery backup is among the bestI was little skeptical about the processing power but i normally play light games so that doesn't seem to be an issue. No issues in day to day task.Overall a good purchase\\n\", \"\\n  Phone is not upto the mark1. You cannot block any app internet usage2. You cannot see daily internet data usage(Not networking usage)3. You cannot see internet speed in status bar4. Screen recording is not there5. No lock screens gesture6. One tap lock screenThese can be small features  but it helps a lot...I didn't  buy chinese phone to support govt atmanirbhar...I am not satisfied with this product.\\n\", '\\n  Bought the device on the first day of its release. Have been using the same for more than a week now and below is the review of its real life performance:Pros:1. It has an amazing display. Samsung is an undeniable champion of amoled displays and this phone is not different in terms of its standards.2. The camera, both front and back, are an amazing tool to play with. The photos come out real sharp and detailed. The single take feature is very handy feature and will be a boon for any beginner who will be able to capture amazing moments with a single click.3. The performance is very snappy for daily use. It is not made for heavy gaming, however it will not disappoint for light gaming.4. The UI experience with the One UI is amazing and smooth.Cons:1. The placement of the fingerprint sensor on the power button and that can be tricky for some of the users to get used to with. 2. It is not supplied with cover and that is strange considering all the smartphones in the segment are supplied with one.Hope the review was helpful.Willl update the review if something noteworthy discovered while using the device.\\n', \"\\n  Excellent display and battery but the delivery  took long enough(6 days) even tho I'm a prime member.overall the phone is Excellent for day to day tasks and mild- moderate gaming. Definitely worth it\\n\", \"\\n  Even intagram is not working. Don't buy this phone. seriously waste of money. No smoothness, slow booting, UI is not user friendly.

(4.5/5).Sensor:The side ways fingerprint is new and it is quick enough..Face Unlock is quite a bit slow..(4/5).Overall:Since I am not a gamer i prefer this phone is worth buying and tried adobe Lr Mobile..It is easier to use and in the range of 20,000 with a good UI with a moderate processor ..This is preferred.. It also comes with Knox Security\\n\", '\\n  Awesome phone better than realme and mi phones\\n', \"\\n  1. Fingerprint reader is very fast.2. Face unlock is a little slow though it can capture your face in a mid range dark room too.Disadvantage of the face unlock was once it cannot recognise your face it does not try again you'll have to use the fingerprint or password.3. Camera quality is amazing in the light but in the dark there's a little disturbance.4. The battery life is not that good as expected though they have advertised a lot about the battery being 6000mah. It's charges pretty fast.5. Reverse charging also works amazing though you cannot charge it to any phone which uses a B cable. Only C to C phones will work for this.6. A phone cover should have been provided with the amount taken. Plus its a little slippery so a phone cover is a must.Overall it's a good phone but these are a few pros and cons when buying the phone.\\n\", \"\\n  If u r not interested in heavy gaming then can't get a better deal for a phone under 20k.Pros-1) Screen - there is no doubt Samsung does provide the best screen. U will notice that instantly,  and Super Amoled is really something if u r coming from ips led screen.2) Battery - Seriously what they advertise is real it really is a monster. Last from1.5 - 2 days depending on ur usage.3) Camera - This is the first time Samsung is using Sony sensor in there below 20k phone and boy can u tell the difference.  Sony sensor with Samsung image processing is just lit, hands down can't get better camera in this budget.4) Software- Being a past redmi and realme user i can tell how much software is important and oneui is very smooth with no blotwares or ads and works really well. I guess after oxygen os and stock Android,  one ui is right behind them.5) Design - This phone looks far better then it looks in images and overall weight balance is great , doesn't feel heavy at all even though having such a massive battery.Cons-1) No Knox security- Don't be confused by all the reviews u find online, there is no knox security included, idk why it shows secured by knox in boot menu but still there is no such thing. It is such a great and convenient thing I just wished they included it here atleast considering the price budget.2) Processor- It has the same exynos 9611 processor thats in their phone that cost around 11-12k . Come on Samsung why are u stuck on the same processor upgrade it there are several better option available.2) Build- It is a plastic body and is very slippery, so requires a cover ,which is not included in box.3) Screen around the front camera gets automatically and returns back to normal after sometimes, since it is a software bug I hope they fix it future updates , sometimes it stuck out and gets a little annoying.\\n\", \"\\n  It is Tejas not Rafael.I don't understand why people giving it 5 stars !Camera image quality not as per my expectations.. I was using Moto G5plus 12 MP Camera and I was satisfied with its camera image quality. :-(Battery lasts for 1.5 day.I can not play IAF game in it.  :-(Processor slow - I feel.It is good phone for average daily use.\\n\", \"\\n  So, it has been few days since I got my hands on Samsung Galaxy M31s, and I've got to say if you like media consumption on phone this is the best. Let me divide this into pros and cons.A. Pros  1. AWESOME DISPLAYI mean it when I say this has got an awesome display. The infinity-O sAmolled display is perfect for media consumption. Sure it has not got that high refresh rate that some Chinese phone makers and high end phones are providing, but the qualtiy of the display, is top notch. (Also like some infinity o displays out there this doesn't have any beading or halo effect around the camera cutout) 2. SINGLE TAKE IS SUPERBYou have to use this feature to get to know how good it is to have it on a phone. There are time when we want to capture a moment both in videos and photos (maybe with some filters) This feature let's you have that. It automatically captures the best photos and videos with just one shot. It's not as good as that in Samsung's flagship phones (just because they can capture using various lens and m31s uses its primary 64MP lens) 3. MONSTER BATTERY LIFEWell that's to be expected right? 6000mah should last you a full day with heavy load (like heavy gaming and media consumption) I had 15-20% remaining battery with heavy use. But mostly with semi-heavy gaming and usage the phone lasted me almost 2 days without charge. 4. WELL OPTIMISED PHONEM31s has android 10 with One UI 2.0 out of the box and it's a well optimised for apps and games. I have not faced any stutter or lag while using apps or playing games like pubg and codm. 5. 25W Super fast chargeSamsung provides with the flagship typec-type c Samsung 25W super charger inside the box. Thus it takes relatively less time to charge the huge 6000 mah battery. 6. Non-Chinese phoneSince boycott Chinese products is going on and most of the smartphone are made in China, this is a phone which is made in India so a good alternative.B. Cons 1. Plastic buildSince it's a plastic back it easily picks up scratches. So I recommend to use a case or a skin on this phone. (Case does not come with phone so you will have to purchase it)Well I don't have any more cons that I can think of. Yes it would have been good if Samsung upgraded the processor, but one UI 2 is well optimised for this particular processor so maybe that's why they didn't upgrade the processor.Basically M31s has a good screen, battery life, awesome camera, good fingerprint reader and is a excellent Samsung phone.\\n\", \"\\n  Big thumbs up for this mobile. Looks great. Only draw back is battery not performing like 6000 mah. Hardly one full day with full battery. Everything else is perfect 5 star.Finger print sensor is lightening quick.UI experience is niceCamera is top notchI feel UI needs few more customizations within ONE UI itself. Case and screen guard should have included in the box. Battery size 6000 mah is eaten up by Exynos processor makes this phone battery offset. No advantage of having 6000 mah battery.I think this is going to be the last phone with these many features in sub 20k range. M51 is going to be sub 30k range for sure.Got this phone with exchange and it's a good deal\\n\", \"\\n  though price great higher than m31 and most specs are similar to the its predecessor, I will prefer M31s to buy as it may sound more future proof. First the things i don't like and i know i am writing cons part first as besides it con part it is actually best phone with everything top notch in its real time usage.* Its processor, in day to day usage didn't find major lags or hang thanks to the great software optimisation with one UI through heavy usage and fast multi tasking might get difficult and i also notice it take more than usual time to power on.* i don't consider it as a con but it is heavy though weight balance is so good that you don't feel it is 200g+ phone* and last one , its about buying a 20k phone ans still not getting a phone case, screen protection and earphones is disappointing to be honest. for initial protection you need these things.* overall couldn't find more negative. i mean there are few small thing but i consider it as personal preference so no complain.some pros-* Its design and its build quality is top notch in the price range of 20k thanks to the added frame and back design.* Its camera department , display is the best* fingerprint scanner is fast though it is parallel to the frame you may need time to use to it.* it is waste actually waste of time to write positives and everything asides cons are great .to be honest i am completly satisfy with this phoneand last thing i prefer 6gb and 128gb varient as it is more value for money . OVERALL A BIG THUMPS UP.\\n\", '\\n  Its been a month. The M31s is working perfectly. Totally in love with it.The best Non-Chinese smartphone you can get in the market right now.I was fed up of Xiaomi phones.Pros:Looks daam premium.Display is the best one you ever see.Sound quality is also top notch.No ads in the UI.6000mah Battery works for 2 days.Camera quality improved than M31 and new features added.Cons:Only thing is, as the back panel has plastic glass, it gets finger prints attracted very fast. You will need to buy a back case to avoid this.\\n', '\\n  The best phone Samsung has ever made in this price segment.1.Display makes this phone to compete with the high end flagships.2.Sony sensor is really an add back to this phone since it takes excellent pictures in daylight especially.3.Most reviewers had commented on the processor part that it is not a gaming one but my experience with this phone was different, tried PubG with ultra setting which worked very smooth and lag free.4. Battery perfomance is other thing which stands out and it last me 1.5 days with single charge.5. Fingerprint and Face unlock are insanely fast.The only drawback was samsung could have added a back cover and Screenguard with the box but what I did was ordered the cover along with the mobile.Overall I will rate 4.5/5 for this phone because this really adds a premium feel and experience.Hope this helps!\\n', \"\\n  Look wise an excellent product,looks better than m30s and m31, infinity o design looks premium and doesn't feel heavy.Rear camera is actually 16mp main shooter, give you 64 MP image by pixel binning technology excellent one,ultra wide is average, macro excellent.Front camera is actually 8mp gives you 32mp image, average in quality.Display is sAmoled excellent, very well visible in day light.Processor exynos 9611 good for routine tasks not great for gaming.Multitasking and ram management is good.Battery backup is excellent. Inspire of fast charger it takes enough time to charge to 100% due to its large size 6000mAh.Side mounted fingerprint sensor is good.Some software related issues are there which can be solved via an OTA update.Operating system Samsung one UI2.0 is good but missing many features like screen recording etc.Overall a very good deal during this independence Day sale.Of course I get a good exchange value for my one old mobile.If you are not a gamer definitely it's worth to buy.Major problem is its wireless Bluetooth connectivity, auto connect and disconnect frequently, Samsung fix this.\\n\", '\\n  The colour combination of the back is so good 🔥. It is normal smartphone like others .And as we know samsung is always known for his sAmoled screen.🙌👌🤘\\n', '\\n  Writing after 15 days of usage.Purchased on Prime Day Sale at 18k. (6GB)Full 5 star on -Samsung Brand, Display, Battery,  Rear Camera.4 Star on -Charging Speed, Front Camera, Speaker.3 Star on -Build Quality, Performance.2 Star on -Weight, Gorilla Glass.1 star on -No Case, No Earphone.Best for Capturing Pics and Videos, Best Viewing Display, Long Battery Backup, No Heating even if Playing 2 hours Continuously, No lagging for Normal and Longer Use.If heavy gamer, playing 3-4 hours continuously on High HD resolution, go with Snapdragon.My usage is normal, not much less and not extreme as well. COMPLETELY SATISFIED.\\n', '\\n  I must say that my decision to wait for this phone was a right decision. When i ordered this phone, it was showing delivery on 20th Aug but i got this awsome phone well before that. I must say that this phone is really awsome, new style fast fingerpeint reader, awsome camera quality, fast charger. The phone is really value for money. 64 MP camera , the pics are so crisp and detailed. Pic colors are vivid and really superb quality.I give full marks to samsung Galaxy M31S and would recommend others if anyone planning to buy a mid range phone. I have come back to samsung after a long period, i must say Samsung has improved a lot.\\n', \"\\n  List of things that I noticed after using for 7days-1. Battery :- As per the mentioned specs the phone got a  massive 6000mah battery 🔋 but as per my usage it lasts hardly for a day ( I didn't try any game and mostly used  for stuff like taking online class ,watching YouTube videos and listening music) but the charger compensates it. It took 2 to 2: 20 hrs to fully charge( depends on condition )2. Camera:-The thing that disappointed me the most is the camera quality of the phone especially the front camera. The front camera is 32mp but the quality of camera is not as good as the no says . It cannot compete with with Chinese co. like Oppo and Vivo in terms of camera. During night even at decent lighting condition the photo it clicks appears to be blurry.White balancing of the photos is not accurate.Live focus is unable to clearly detect the edges of the photos.I previously had Vivo v15 having 32mp 1.5 yrs older whose camera quality is far better from this device which arrived later than that.3. Dark mode is awesome that at night we even cannot distinct the edges of phone and the screen.I loved it4.Design:- Design of this device is 👍 👌5. Sound quality is decent6 Processor: Samsung should have provided better chipset than this.7.While I was taking class on Unacademy within 20mins it got heat up.8.Screen:- Screen is awesome,the s-amoled screen produces awesome colors and the viewing experience is great on this deviceHope samsung fixes the list of problems  I mentioned especially the camera capture during night through the next update\\n\", \"\\n  Camera : too good. Pics cameout fantastic on all cameras(haven't checked night time performance but low light performance indoors was good) without any over-saturation or discontinuity/fading issue like similar priced oppo /vivo mobiles.Battery: slightly better than m30 and there's 25w fast charging. Almost 5 hrs of SOT on medium brightness n mixed use of media, browsing/shopping wifi.Screen: Its samsung. I don't need to say anymore.No lag of any kind seen since. The only cons i felt r the phone is on heavier side, exynos processor( u'll consider only if u Need to play pubg like graphic intense games on topmost settings)  and may be the fingerprintScanner position, fr some. I got used to it in a day but took my mom 3 days now she's ok with it.\\n\", \"\\n  It's an absolutely fluid machine. Awesome sensors at the right place. Just wondering if Samsung would make profit by selling this phone at this price. I am sure they are limited quantity and would be taken off soon. The fingerprint sensor is very sensitive and responds with diligence. The great feature is its power-packed camera which not only has extremely powerful lenses, but blended with lossless software to encode it. Battery survives for 2 days, with extensive use for calling and listening to music. I am a lisztomaniac, so you may imagine. Thanks. Very contended.\\n\", '\\n  \\xa01. It is smooth in grip meanwhile but due to plastic mix body changes of slip reduces.2. Lock button with fingerprint scanner is really a great concept.Double press function, notification tray slide are some features.3. You can have Alarms/Playback/Events/Weather on Lock screen.4. Almost every function is available on notification tray.5. Super Amloed Screen gives you a glance experience.6. Customize your phone according to you.\\n', \"\\n  I'm updating my review after 20 days of use. Super display i love it. Great UI. Very good interface (smart switch app) from Samsung to transfer data from old to new phone, effortless. Camera is good, i hope it will improve with updates.I hate bloatware. I purchased 8Gb RAM version, but out of 8 gb, only half is available, it is irritating some times. I observed a bit of lag while playing mine craft. So, I must say that processor can be improved.Overall, good phone, considering non-chinese brand.\\n\", '\\n  Overall good  experience, my rating would be 3.5.Pros:1. Size : Good for movie & gaming.2. Camera : Very good, works exceptionally good in night mode.3. Look and feel : Vivid, typical samsung type.4. Pre- installed softwares: Limited and only required ones. good from security aspect.5. Weight : Feels heavy and when in pocket will definitely make u a feel that u are carrying something worth not losing.Cons:1. Phone heats up if used continuously for 30 mins for phone calls.2. Even video calls and you tube playbacks heats the phone near camera area. Pretty unexpected from an highend phone from Samsung3. Battery: Not a good performance as per 6000 mah. LAsts for a day with normal usage, i.e. phone calls, whatsapp, 1 hour youtube video, and some browsing. To be honest, i am disappointed on battery performance looking at its size especially when Samsung made it a big USP.4. Crux: You have better options in this price range, would recommend to try those instead of blowing 21,500 on this phone.5. Processor: Samsung has not done any big changes in its old Exynios Genre.Must go ahead..But Samsung has been a miser..did not provide  rear silicon cover.Charging cable length is just OK IN length.\\n', \"\\n  This is amazing value for money mobile, earlier i was using asus but changing mobile worth it.Battery: no worries charge within 1:40 hr, whuch is great compare to other mobiles.Camera:awsome, it captures what you needed.Screen :it's samsung USP it could never go wrong.Processor 9611: i also have some concerns before buying but it's not bad. many review available in internet saying processor is not good, but believe me i play lots of game (Pubg, COD, Asphalt, Mortal combat etc most game size 2.5 gb) , do not find any problem, only difference isduring first time game loading takes few seconds extra as compared to new processors.  So while playing no issue.Screen refresh rate: it's a myth 90 hrtz is better compared to 60, hidden fact is your eyes are only detecting 30 frames/hrtz, so your eyes are not even usung 60 hrtz frequency.Weight: yes it's slightly heavy bit do not hurt while typing or gaming, weight is well balanced.Protection: No comments, I always cover my mobile with screen gauard and back cover,  looks and sturdyness are also fine for me. But for this point you could count on other internet reviews, as i am playing safe with my mobile.\\n\", '\\n  I have recieved this mobile on 13th Aug, delivery well in advance. Mobile looks and features all looks superb. Suddenly on 21st august the mobile started giving advanced touch error and then screen gone off. Now the mobile display is off. Return window is closed on 20th Aug. Service centres are working only on limited days. I had to purchase a mobile immediately for my daily job. Samsung customer care also giving false information related to service centre. I go to office and find time only on saturday and sunday. Service centre is open only on monday, wed and friday that too with limited manpower. I purchased samsung mobile for the first time and now feeling bad about my decision. A latest mobile with limited application downloaded has suddenly crashed. Waste of my money.\\n', \"\\n  If you are not an heavy user then this phone is perfect for you but if you are a student, and  searching for a new smart phone this is not for youIn the first class you will find it perfect but as the class goes on and the 4 or 5 period came it wil start manking frame drops and lagsYou will notice an frame drops in animation while opening and closing of an app, or while switching between apps or in scrolling. I didn't know is the problem is in my device only or if the device is like that onlyI strongly not recommended you to buy this phone because its not able to handel the load of online classes then if you are a heavy user how will it survive in heavy usageAnd please don't trust on youtube reviews of this smartphone they are totally fake.And yaa its camera too its camera in low light condition is more useless then the sit of an dog\\n\", '\\n  I am facing two problems1. Fingerprint Sensor not so good as my previous  A6 Plus.2. Front Camara is shaking.Apart  from this Amazon packaging  is very  very simple  & bad.\\n', '\\n  Received the phone today.  Inserted SIM.  Started phone.  Wi-Fi  problem couldn’t authenticate connection.  Reset whole Router with new SSID and Key.  Reconnected all other devices with new SSID and key including my old Redmi Phone.  All devices got connected except this brand new Samsung.Called Amazon Customer care.  They advised for a hard factory reset.  Did factory reset twice.  Still the same problem.  First impression is the last impression – May be Samsung hasn’t heard of it.  As of now they have allotted a technician to look into it.\\n', \"\\n  After using it for a week,in this price range definitely a good gadget.Touch,camera,processor speed,finger print sensor up to the mark.A lot has been said for the battery,it charges fast only if you off the net,location,keep phone on power saver than it charges in 90mins otherwise it takes 130 mins to charge,battery drains too quickly than M31.All other aspects are good,one can buy if don't want to go for Chinese one.\\n\", \"\\n  To begin with the phone is a complete package. Display gives an amazing experience, no doubt it's a battery monster coupled with 25 watt fast charging, reverse charging offers a great advantage, rear cameras give the best shots in the price segment, they add great variety also, front camera is good, the auto wide angle selfie feature is really handy, but sharpness can be improved. Single take is fun to use. Side mounted fingerprint sensor is really quick. It has Knox security but it's limited as it doesn't have secure folders and other A series features. Though made of plastic it still has a premium look and feel unlike the previous M series phones. Single mono bottom firing speaker is adequately loud but sounds a bit tinny at times. Dolby Atmos is present only for headsets and the music output is excellent. Processor is not made for gaming, hardcore gamers stay away. It's smooth and breezy for day today tasks. Multi tasking is no issue. OneUI 2.1 has excellent improvements over the previous versions. Call quality, network reception is absolutely fine. Internet download and upload speeds are quite satisfactory. Overall it's a great experience. Loved it\\n\", \"\\n  Samsung has been giving the best amoled displays for quite some time now. This phone keeps up with the tradition. There is No 90 or 120 Hz refresh rate so yes that can be an argument as competition offers that.But then Samsung display is Samsung display. You just can't get wrong with it when it comes to watching videos.M Series is known for its battery, and the M31s delivers a punch here. Also, despite a beefy battery, phones ergonomics are pretty well handled and overall grip is comfortable (but sligthly heavy) thanks to back end curves.Phone looks and feels beautiful and the polycarbonate material build quality feels good but I don't intend to test it. Back is a finger print magnet.The Exynos 9611 SOC is good enough for less power hungry games but there is frame lag in certain games which demand graphics. Overall with 6000 mAh battery, a better optimization by 9611 SOC might have led to more than 2 day life, but no one is complaining.Call quality and reception is pretty good.Okay, the best part is Camera! Somehow Samsung has managed to fit a very very decent camera in to this one. Yes colors can be over saturated (5/10 times) but it's the same with most phones these days as perhaps the general public likes punchy colors.Video recording is pretty fine tooBut the winner here is the Night mode. Don't know what got into Samsung's head and they have accidently incorporated a very improved night mode for a M-series phone (less noise and better field of exposure). Its easily the best night mode in under 20,000/- category of phones.Even the 12 MP ultra-wide takes better pictures than other ultra-wides in daylight.Overall a good solid phone. Samsung is always guilty of over pricing (may be their screen costs more or whatever), but still would attract many. A price of 18000/- may just have killed the competition, but may be not this time.Disclaimer:I'm a very casual gamer, mostly see movies on Netflix and Amazon Prime video and so display and battery are my priority and the M31s doesn't disappoint here.Clear advantage is the camera, specially it's Night Mode.The 9611 SoC handles my daily routine well and 6GB RAM eases multi-tasking problems for the SoC. So didn't notice any lag in my experience so far.Min storage is 128 GB, and I really never needed more. You can always use a micro SD card to futher add storage.The review is based on my usage and i feel most of the crowd uses phone for social networking, web browsing and occassional gaming, so any basic SoC can handle it fine.\\n\", \"\\n  The processor is pathetic, your phone would start lagging as soon as you start to use it. I had hoped that samsung one UI won't have many bugs but it has crucial bugs linked with speaker and mic that won't resolve after updates. Sound quality is okay for movies and stuff but pathetic for music. On top of that, Amazon won't accept returns and replacement is too much hassle. I'm used to buying literally everything online but that stops now. The only good thing with this phone are nice display and fingerprint and an average camera with bad camera app. If you can shell out a little more go for little higher end phones with better processor and never buy an Exynos\\n\", \"\\n  Samsung m31s this is a super phone which never I have seen my life extraordinary battery life and extraordinary camera features and superb fingerprint reader fast and accurate than other phones in this phone Face Unlock is also so fast .In the box they didn't provide any case for the phone and no earphones for the phone but in a series they will provide a case and earphones and in the M series wild didn't provide case and earphones I don't know this is I was disappointed in Samsung M series so but the phone is superb and naturally grade in camera quality so perfect and I appreciate the Samsung offices to make a Sony sensor of 64 megapixel super phone in the 2020 year thank you for Samsung officers taking this phone to market\\n\", \"\\n  Another well desinged model from Samsung M seriece with high capacity battery. Android 10 + Dark Mode best combination for Samsung display to viewPros-Design & Display The design of the mobile is awesome with 6.5 Inch Super Amoled Full HD display. Big screen to watch movies. The pixels resolution and smoothness of the screen is damn good. Nobody can beat Samsung in terms of dispaly. Glassy finishing at back side is too good. Edges and screen ratio is fine. Classy look. UI is awesome- Storage 6GB/8GB RAM is definitely huge, helpful for gamers, mutli purpose users. I didnt see any lagging or hanging till now while using. 128GB storage is lot to store-Battery Battery life is good. Lasting 24hours after more use, still 30% or 35% power will be remained.-Charger The charger cable is coming with Type C at both sides. Very fast charging 25W.  Reverse charge is provided in this model which is good option to lend some charging to others (Can use M31S as a powerbank :P)-Camera Came with new feature Single Take which helps you to capture realtime photos and video at the same time (Slow motion video, Fast Forward video, edited photos). Camera clearity is good and decent, Macro, Live Focus options will bring the creative photographer in you, but when I compared with Mi Cam I feel Mi cam sharpness is better-Processor Coming with Exynos 9611 processor. Works really fast and good without lagging.Cons- Since the size is big little bit difficulut to operate with single hand, but now a days it's not a big issue- Fingerprint scanner is not very accuarate, sometimes you may feel disgusting to unlock, even face lock also slow in response sometimes. Can be improved- Sound Quality is good but volume is not much- No indicator for notifications- Unncessary preinstalled Samsung apps- Ads on the screenPrice could have been set 18k as there is no much difference between M31 and M31S in terms of battery, processor, camera (Except Single Take). Must buy for Samsung Lovers\\n\", \"\\n  SAMSUNG GALAXY M31S is really a very good phone with very advanced features it have all the features what the company claims . The enhanced feel of the phone is really classy and it will make you feel.you are getting a premium phone at this affordable price , go for it. 😍 I am giving this review after one week of receiving it , I have tasted it's camera , battery and everything and I'm giving a honest review after using it .1. CAMERA - 10/10 The camera is superb64 + 12 + 5 + 5 MP Quad Primary CamerasLED Flash32 MP Front Camera, No Front FlashThe camera is up to the mark it will make photos so beautiful 😍2. BATTERY - 9/10 The company says it has mega battery of 6000mAh with super fast charger . I would say the charger is really fast . It takes almost one and a half hour to fully charge it and then the battery last for maximum 2 days3. PERFORMANCE - 10/10  the phone comes with Octa core (2.3 GHz, Quad Core + 1.7 GHz, Quad core) Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 6 GB RAM. The performance of this phone is really mind blowing you will feel amazing after using it.4. DISPLAY - 10/10 the phone comes with 6.5 inches (16.51 cm) 405 PPI, Super AMOLED. The display is really very good. It has a huge display if you like to watch videos and movies then this phone is for you.5. BACK COVER - 10/10 I honestly say the outer cover of this phone is just amazing 🙌 for the phone cover I would really like to appreciate Samsung as the cover is very classy and the cover is of glass body so the in hand feel of the phone is really premium.\\n\", \"\\n  Using it since last 3 days and nothing significant  o complain other than fingerprint sensor. I guess this is little pricey compared to China phones  especially  comparing to MI Redmi note series which are are almost 40% cheaper and slightly better. Nevertheless I purchased Samsung believing they have stringent quality  checks compared to Chinese.Cons:1) Fingerprint sensor located on the side is annoying since it is tricky to unlock when used with a TPU back case. I would have appreciated if the sensor was on rear instead which would have been very convenient  compared to side to use. Don't use any case if you want the fingerprint  sensor to be less annoying  or choose the ones having sensor only in the rear or indisplay..2) setting  up this phone Initially is very annoying  and consumes lit of time. God knows what updates it is updating in the background which seem i could not find3) Little pricey compared to MI redmi note series phones,  I was using redmi note7s  prior to this phone. The hardware is more or less comparable to MI redmi series phones which are available at much cheaper prices...I purchased Samsung and just avoided the temptation of Chinese  phones in respect to boycott..otherwise they are pocket friendly. Hope samsung reads this review and refund me and bring down the prices a little bit as wellPros:1) Samsung brand, assume completely made in india...not sure how many chinee components  are used though2) display and battery3) decent camera4) does not over heat during normal use\\n\", '\\n  Good mobile with great changes like..1: Single Take2: Glastic body3: Monster Battery4: Awesome camera with great features\\n', \"\\n  So after using the M31s for more than 3 weeks, I have a mixed feeling about the device.Things I love about the phone:1. Display2. Clean UI3. Looks good compared to other M seriesThinks which are just Ok:1. The camera is identical to the older M31 and thus is underperforming.2. The battery isn't that monstrous as they claim. Felt like 4000 mAh. But still takes 3 hours and 40 minutes to get fully charged.3. External speakers are better than other M series but aren't good as most mid-rangers.4. Dolby Atmos audio failed to meet expectations as it is only good for enhancing the treble (Great help if you are old).Thinks I hate:1. Bulky and heavy. Feels like some walkie-talkies that I used to have during my childhood!2. Poor performance for this price! Can't even play games like Asphalt 9 without lags and frame drops.3. No option for random wallpapers with the One UI 2.4. Face unlock is pretty slow and thus is an obsolete feature!5. A slippery and plasticky body which acts as dirt and fingerprint magnet. Back of the phone is now full of scratch.6. The phone rebooted by itself 15 times in 22 days which is something scary for me!7. Unable to feel that Samsung signature, I can't explain why but feels like those Chinese brands on hand.\\n\", '\\n  Guys please beware. Worst ever phone from Samsung. Touch is of pathetic quality. Heavy phone and not user friendly. Very poor service from Amzon. Within an hour I am raising this for return, however No response from Amazon. Time to quit Amazon\\n', \"\\n  All featured specifications are up to the mark.Camera lovers.. highly recommend for you. #Intelli-cam, #Hyperlapse..But in this price segment, you could have expected Snapdragon 845 or 730G or a better processor in this phone instead of Exynos 9611.Good:•Excellent battery life, Monster 6000mAh.•Reverse charging.•Side mounted fingerprint sensor.•Crisp AMOLED display.•Bundled 25w fast charger.•Easy grip & sleek design.•Camera switching. Thumbs-up.• Has 3.5mm jack. (Thanksgiving)•Note like fealings to mid rangers. With PENUP support.Bad:•Doesn't offer earphones in the box. (Why samsung?)•Old processor.•No back cover included.•No clipboard for cut, copy & paste.•Major missing of important apps like Samsung Flow, Pass and Secure Folder* which you easily get in A Series.Glastic Back Panel is not so impressive when you pay Rs.21k+*Hope Samsung will fix and offer these in upcoming updates.\\n\", '\\n  Battery is discharging very fast. Its a worst  choice  to choose  dis phone. Thought  to hav a long battery  life. But its discharging  very fast.More over Amazon  asking to install a software to check the things. And dat software is not having battery option.Guys opt some other. Its useless.\\n', '\\n  Screen is vibrant.Camera is good.Battery life is superb. One can easily get 2 to 2.5 days of battery on one full charge.One UI provided by Samsung is quite good. No lags or heating for day to day usage.25 watt charger. Reverse charging.Phone is not very heavy.Cons:Phone costs around 20000. Samsung should provide features like Samsung Pass in this phone.Panel is made of plastic. It get scratches very easily. One has to apply back cover to avoid this.No water resistant rating provided or mentioned.M30, M30s, M31, M31s all have same processor i.e.  Exynos 9611, which is based on 10nm. On other hand many cheaper phones are using 8nm processors which is more efficient. Samsung is charging good amount of money for some incremental changes.\\n', \"\\n  This is my 3rd Samsung Mobile. I was a big fan of Xaomi Redmi Mobiles, had 4 of them; I still am a fan, except for some performance issues, quality and other worrying issues with security, as its Chinese. Don't know when the updates stop as Xaomi stopped updates of its UI year after year for some 2-3 year old models too.Lately after purchasing Samsung Tab.. I am once again wooed and wowed by Samsung Quality & performance.Its SECURITY & PERFORMANCE that landed me here with M31S. I have no complains except for screenshot feature which is easy in Redmi & little cumbersome in Samsung, yet a 5* for everything from Samsung.  I admit and say that this M31S has a bundle of features to explore. The camera is very very impressive and pro mode is simply exquisite.\\n\", \"\\n  Georgius, awesome!It is powerhouse of battery, camera, processer and smooth fabulous display. It is better than other China's smartphone in this price. Only one thing who gave unsatishfaction that it is time telephoto,Periscope lens but samsung didn't work on it still.I hope samsung work in future immediately.\\n\", '\\n  Happy to switch to samsung phones from all other chinese phones i owned previously.Samsung has inbuilt device care app which manages the ram and saves battery and puts apps to sleep when not required. You also get samsung max premium VPN service for free although you will have to select the premium service from samsung max app bcz by default basic service is selected for everyone. Kindly note bcz the VPN is free its slow. Comes with Dolby atmos feature but ya dolby atmos can only be used with headphones and works with Bluetooth headphones too. What I liked about samsung is the dolby atmos feature provided is not there for show it really works amazing when you listen to real dolby atmos content using headphones on the phone . For me I am satisfied with this phone\\n', \"\\n  Pros: -In hand feeling is great with unique gradient look.-The cameras of this one is just amazing. Photography might become ur hobby with the ultimate quad camera setup in this device.- Fingerprint sensor is modern and works really well.- Super amoled display and the speakers with punchy sound gives a completely different experience with the multimedia.-25 watts charger is the cherry on the cake.Cons:-A back cover could have been provided because the back is a fingerprint magnet.- A bit advanced processor could have made this phone an asset worth possessing (Only for hard core gamers).Conclusion- Being a moderate user, I am really happy with this Samsung device. It's a big competition to any other smartphones in this range in the market at this point of time.\\n\", '\\n  Aesthetics :First of all the phone is very good to look at. The glossy finish on the back of the phone where the colours merge looks good. The one down side is back side of the phone is a finger print magnet and be ready to invest in a good back cover for the phone. It would be good if samsung provides a good cover in the package for the phone as they are providing for some models in the m series.Camera:The phone has good camera on paper and lives up to its expectations in the real world. in well lit scenario it provides very good results. The low light scenario is really challenging even for the top of the line phones. This phone is also no exception in low light scenario I see a bit of noise and loss of detail.Battery Backup:The big thing about the phone is the battery and it is able to hold the battery for two and half days of normal usage.Software Updates:One thing I remain skeptical is how long samsung will provide software updates, I think it is for 2 years but I would be happy if get for 3 to 4 years.Conclusion:So, if you are looking for a good phone under Rs.20000 this is a phone that will and should be in the first three places in your list of phones.\\n', \"\\n  It's not about giving review, it's about sharing my experiences with someone who need to buy this from hard earned money. I don't share my mobile picture because its my whole thing now.Why you have to buy this?1. Mobile look is awesome.2. Performance is really good, behind my expectation.3. Side finger print sensor is working than what you think, meanwhile faceunlock also working soo good.4. Battery stands upto 14hrs rough use, but I'm not try it more than twice.5. Edge to Edge perfection in screen looks and handy to use.6. Don't worry about price because Samsung 25W get know you it's perfect.7. UI 2.1 gives you different experience.8. PUBG is really working equal to other competitors.So why you should not buy this1. If you want a 5G network don't think about this mobile.2. Signal strength is not improved like other M series mobile, I feel its have to look by samsung.3. Battery save mode ( Medium power saving) not perfect as I seen before.4. Faceunlock consumes more battery.Don't confuse by review if you want a mobile classy, good performance and updated trend choose this because it has everything. Expect 5G.\\n\", \"\\n  Feels good to hold. It is a plastic body but still seems quite premium.The camera is good. Not a flagship so  ant expect much. But a lot better than my  previous samsung s8. The single take feature is a load of c**p. Or maybe I haven't used it efficiently yet.Battery backup is simply awesome. Don't.  Have to keep plugging in. But again the 25w fast charging is a load of c**p. My previous moto g6 had 18w turbo charger and that worked a lot better. Though that battery capacity was low as well. But gave me equivalent backup.Screen is the best part. It's beautiful, huge and crisp with minimal pinhole obstruction. Good colour saturation and brightness. Face unlock is just a tad bit slow. Fingerprint sensor is a bit of an issue. New position at the side on the unlock switch but more importantly it is not the most responsive\\n\", \"\\n  Bought the 6Gb/128Gb Mirage Black variant..- Battery does not feel like 6000 mAh just one day max with medium to robust usage..- Camera is good but the 64MP feels like some 16/32MP..Macro lens also not upto the mark..- Only good thing is display in S-AMOLED..which is again a common thing in all of samsung's mid range smart phones..so not a big deal- Issue with network as wellI simply din understand how a flagship level phone which created soo muchhh hype in the market turned out to be a big S###..Samsung just foxed the customers taking the ongoing anti-china emotion into their advantage..JUST A BIG THUMBS DOWN FROM MY SIDE...\\n\", \"\\n  Although i was super excited for the product, but after receiving it i was little disappointed for the camera.The camera is not upto the markThe front camera looks like 16mp only and clicks smudgy pics. Plus you have to keep your hand super stable otherwise it clicks blurry pics.The plus point of the phone is it's built quality. Does not looks like it has 6000mah battery. Plus the display is also very good. The side mounted fingerprint button click is not so good, but okk.The processor is really bad, not very smooth.\\n\", '\\n  I am a oneplus user. I just bought this for my mom usage. I have been using it for week. After the present situation  of against the made in china products. I just blindly  booked Samsung after gone through  some reviews in YouTube.Totally waste of money. U will find lags in each animation. I regreat for my worst decision  ever.Dont buy if u are looking  for a good product.\\n', \"\\n  Simply brilliant! I definitely think this is the best phone to buy if one has the budget of about 20K. The battery is long lasting, the cameras are better than any other phone in its category and the screen is magnificent.The only little glitch is the fingerprint scanner on the left of the phone. It can be really uncomfortable for people with small fingers. And it isn't as responsive as it should be. I had to press at least  twice to unlock the phone. Maybe I am a bit too casual with my touch, but its definitely an issue.However, besides the above minor issue, I think this is a brillphone by Samsung for people who want to have a good viewing experience,  a great set of cameras and a long lasting battery.\\n\", '\\n  Excellent photos with Sony IMX682, But low light captures are very poor. Battery is good, can manage two days with normal usage. A bit laggy while playing multiple games Simultaneously with 6 GB RAM. Anyways the screen is super amoled which is pretty much common in samsung devices, watch movies with super quality when compare with Chinese mobiles in this range.\\n', \"\\n  All good. Comes preloaded with some 3rd party softwares, that was a bit irritating but all can be uninstalled. Great value for money though. Battery lasts full 24 hrs with heavy bluetooth usage with my earbuds and wireless ON all the time. Takes around 1.5 hrs to charge completely. It has Knox security but remember, it's not water proof so be cautious in rain and near pools, tanks, bathroom, etc. Feeling on screen is good. Great with multiple apps open at the same time. Do not forget to put TPU cover or armor guard with some screen guard. My friend dropped his 2 days old M31s from half a meter height and screen is shattered and gone black completely.  I think original screen replacement from the authorised service center is 8.5k. Better safe than sorry. Worth every penny for this price. I bought in prime day sale so got 1500/- additional discount.\\n\", '\\n  This is perfect for day to day usage with fantastic camera quality. There is no full version of Knox security. Processor is not for high gaming. Battery is descent but you can get 5830mah like battery life because of this processor.Display is awesome.And there is a hidden app lock system with samsung max app for data saving and privacy protection.Fingerprint sensor is very fast but face unlock is secure.There is a unique single take feature.And it is a non Chinese  phone.Build quality is awesome.Big screen bright writing  is very helpful for students.\\n', \"\\n  I booked M31s on 6th August 01 AM but it's deliver to me on 15th August, almost after 10 days. It's came to me with my another ordered medical oil in a single outer box and mobile box is damaged. U can see the box photographs.Such a valuable products coming along with a oil bottle. This is ridiculous delivery experience by amazon seller.Except photography and display nothing is special to me after 3 days using experience. UI is not up to the mark. Advertisement is coming on screen while calling. Battery is 6000 mah but not getting service like 6000 mah. No screen guard or PU back cover inside the box. Finger print sensor is just ok not super fast. Body is plastic and definitely u will face the scratches issue. Price should be under 17K is perfect for this phone. I'm using 6/128 GB variant.Will update after using 1 month.\\n\", '\\n  Pros - This phone has monsterous 6000 mah battery, reverse charging and Samoled display. Coming about single take camera make this phone more interesting and look wise make this phone best under 20k.Cons - only con is processer. Exynos 9611 since 2 yrs samsung is using this processor in mid rangeOverall pubg is running smoothly because of optimization\\n'], 'url': 'https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-712/dp/B07DJCJBB3/ref=sr_1_25?dchild=1&fst=as%3Aoff&pf_rd_i=6308595031&pf_rd_m=A1K21FY43GMZF8&pf_rd_p=2c2b4d9e-f15e-4cf3-8e5c-acf68c668c41&pf_rd_r=80WR7NYVY11014AWK7F7&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-5&pf_rd_t=101&qid=1601263641&refinements=p_85%3A10440599031&rnid=10440598031&rps=1&s=electronics&sr=1-25', 'category': 'Mobile', 'destination_urls': ['https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A0789677KRMPAXGBRXRR&qualifier=1602311116&id=6575031689611218&widgetName=sp_detail&url=%2Fdp%2FB08J3D1NKS%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1%26pd_rd_i%3DB08J3D1NKS%26pd_rd_w%3DZJ3jT%26pf_rd_p%3D1801b34c-8af9-42b5-8961-11f124edc99b%26pd_rd_wg%3DIg6Ua%26pf_rd_r%3DDTAJR07P4TXA3A8F1AVE%26pd_rd_r%3D129175d3-b6f6-4345-8773-64806f5d963e', '/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/dp/B07HGN617M/ref=bmx_1/258-7785893-3713612?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07HGN617M&pd_rd_r=129175d3-b6f6-4345-8773-64806f5d963e&pd_rd_w=Su0bk&pd_rd_wg=Ig6Ua&pf_rd_p=08abe11d-4ee5-46ca-8471-7bf18c53fc91&pf_rd_r=DTAJR07P4TXA3A8F1AVE&psc=1&refRID=DTAJR07P4TXA3A8F1AVE', '/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/dp/B07HGGYWL6/ref=pd_sbs_107_1/258-7785893-3713612?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07HGGYWL6&pd_rd_r=129175d3-b6f6-4345-8773-64806f5d963e&pd_rd_w=A3tdx&pd_rd_wg=Ig6Ua&pf_rd_p=00b53f5d-d1f8-4708-89df-2987ccce05ce&pf_rd_r=DTAJR07P4TXA3A8F1AVE&psc=1&refRID=DTAJR07P4TXA3A8F1AVE', 'https://www.amazon.in/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?ie=UTF8&adId=A0789677KRMPAXGBRXRR&qualifier=1602311116&id=1314152733801911&widgetName=sp_detail2&url=%2Fdp%2FB08J3D1NKS%2Fref%3Dsspa_dk_detail_0%3Fpsc%3D1']}, {'_id': {'$oid': '5f815873aaa28c53dfe2b481'}, 'description': 'boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Wireless Headset with Super Extra Bass, IPX5 Water & Sweat Resistance, Qualcomm Chipset and Up to 6H Playback (Active Black)', 'price': '₹1,399', 'rating': '3.9 out of 5 stars', 'review_count': '131,120', 'reviews': ['\\n  No doubt it has a great bass and to a great extent noise cancellation and decent sound clarity and mindblowing battery but the following dissapointed me though i tried a lot to adjust.1.Bluetooth range not more than 10m2.

So Battery life is pretty awesome.Comfortable on ear.\\n', \"\\n  I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones.PROS:1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.CONS:1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.Final words:Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms).Thank you for reading.

Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise.

And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much.

I have been cheated by Boat India!I bought these headphones however, they stopped working within first 15days of purchase. I tried to file a complaint online but failed several times. Then I decided to go to the service centre but returned empty-handed because they did not have a new set neither they have parts to repair it. I tried writing emails to them several times again no response. Disheartened by the feeling of wasting my money into a fraud company, I tried reaching out to them by posting my feedback on Facebook but every time they removed my post from their page without any revert.Please do not buy this because it is cheaper than other brands! By any chance, if the set is faulty you WILL HAVE TO BEG THEM FOR A SERVICE!!!!!\\n', \"\\n  Let me tell you that don't buy this. Yes it's true that it's the best product you can get for the price (I doubt that) but definitely it's not the best product YOU should buy.Problems faced:1. Battery is pathetic. Mostly gives 3 hours of playtime2. The earphones get disconnected if you even go to the next room3. Sound is too low. I have to use 3rd party Equalizer to listen clearly4. The bass is also not good. Have to rely on the 3rd party appsThe only thing is Boat has a very good warranty service but the problems with the device make it a garbage af\\n\", '\\n  The main reason I bought this wireless earphone is Pubg mobile and I heard a lot of about Latency issues in wireless earphones but this one amazed me truely.1. YOU WILL HEAR FOOTSTEP WITHOUT ANY LATENCY ISSUE.2. THE BATTERY BACKUP IS ABSOLUTELY MINDBLOWING. (6-8 HOURS SMOOTHLY WITH 8/10 VOLUME RATIO WHICH I FEEL IS SUFFICIENT).3. THE BASE IS JUST PERFECT FOR GAMING AND MUSIC, NO PAIN IN EAR AND NO BLUNDER OF BASE WHILE HEARING EDM OR FIRING FROM AKM.I have used Rockerz 255, Oneplus Bullet wired and Mivi but nothing can be compared in front of 255 Pro.Best product with the best price!\\n', '\\n  Totally disappointed with the product and returned it. Boat rockerz 225 is better than this.\\n', '\\n  Got the delivery today(12/12/2018)Initial Impressions:The Audio was really good..nice bass..comfortable fit.Audio 4/5But after few hours of usage the right earphone stopped working..Audio output through right earphone is not as loud as left earphone.\\n', '\\n  I am pleased to write a review and i will talk both about pros and cons:Pros:1. Good Bass2. Sturdy3. Great look4. Good noise cancellationCons:1. Forget buying this if you are planning to use it for gaming like battle royale games, There is an issue with the latency or bluetooth lag, You will hear the noise 3 seconds after you fire the gun.2. Disspointed battery backup, max is 1 or 1.5. hours if you continously use it at low volume.3. Wrong place where the charging port is installed, difficult to plugin or plug out.UPDATE: AS OF TODAY, JAN 15TH 2020 - One of the sides stopped working within 6 months. However, I claimed the warranty and got a replacement in 15 days. No hassle apart from the duration to get a replacement.\\n', '\\n  Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.\\n', \"\\n  Purchased on 20/02/20 and It's stopped working. Neither it's turning on neither it's getting charged. Registered an online complain on 21/05/20 but till date there is no reponse.Complain tkt no. Is 1111830. Someone from boat team kindly connect and respond to help me out on this.Finally they replaced the faulty product and it's working great now.\\n\", \"\\n  Just purchase it with your eyes closed man. In 1500 bucks no-one will ever give you such a Bass and good audio quality WIRELESS BLUETOOTH Earphone. Just don't think so much.I don't know about the lasting of the product but feeling the build it seems very premium. This is my first day usage review.===≠====≠===Writing after 5 months of usingOne of earbud stopped working without any reason today.Pathetic product I must say now\\n\", \"\\n  There's no clarity in sound it produces only bass that to it is not pure deep bass. It's sounds very local the mids n highs are the worst. One may go for it by looking at the price but trust me Bass in not the only thing to be considered the sound quality is also very important. Even the bass is not all pure it just sucks when u hear it for more than 1 hrs. I have returned the product. Please don't buy this product there's no Sound Quality.\\n\", \"\\n  4 stars just for audio quality with good bass but noice cancellation doesn't work.Prosaudio quality is really goodnice battery backuprange is fineConsnoice cancellation is bad while talkingIts good for music lovers who need a good audio quality headphones but not for those who need for calling purpose because the other person you're talking with will even hear the background noise coming from long distances like vehicles passing and their horn.Rest everything is good.\\n\", '\\n  Worst product\\n', '\\n  I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon\\'s insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating \"You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255\"2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it\\'s my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it\\'s a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.\\n', '\\n  Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.\\n', '\\n  I have been using this product for more then 6 months.At the time of perchesing this earphone, i was really confuse between Realme or Boat Rockers pro.but after boot rockers pro, I am very happy with my decision.Very Good product by boat.I thought that 6hrs battery backup will be less for me but after usning i have seen that it gives more 8 hrs and it only takes 20 min max to get full charge.6 hr is for if you have been playing non-stop music for 6hrs.I put on charging only for 20-25 min in morning and use it full day without turnning off for a single minute.To be true the performance was amazing..Here is some key information about the product: 1.It can connect with 2 device at same time.I connect with my phone and laptop which is very benifitial for me, I attain meeting and online classes on laptop and in between any phone call comes on my mobile it automatical switches towords call and after the call back to my lappy. when i play video on both phone or laptop it automatical switch towords whereever video is playing. 2.support fast charging(only in the \"PRO\" modle). 3.Audio quality is best. 4. light weight.\\n', \"\\n  So this is my take on the boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Bluetooth after one month of usage and hope this satisfies most of the queries here.Pros:------1. Pretty Quick Connectivity. It hardly took me less than a minute to get started with it.2. The sound quality is quite good. While driving on high altitude windy areas, the sound clarity is still clear and that makes me give it a thumbs up.3. The battery life lasts for almost 3 days and thats quite reasonable for meCons:-------1. Though there aren't many cons but yes the noise cancellation is quite less when compared to many other earphones2. Quality checks need to be taken care of since we had to get one of our earphones exchanged due to connectivity issueOverall it is a great value for money for earphones. Do pick it up,\\n\", '\\n  Need  to claim warranty one  side  speaker  is not  working\\n', '\\n  Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.\\n', \"\\n  Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express\\n\", \"\\n  Got this for Rs. 999. A great deal for the price.Bought it socially for multipoint features.Works great with 2 mobiles but I have found that it keeps running into connecting issues with a Windows 10 laptop. It may take a while to connect back with a Windows 10 laptop.Battery is okay. Can't take it off the whole day.Don't expect noise cancellation. Sound is great. You can enjoy bass. Another little annoying thing apart from connecting with Windows Laptop is the crackling sound which I can hear sometime for no reason even in close proximity of the streaming device.\\n\", '\\n  For the first month it was good. But from the starting i was having blue tooth connectivity issue. It was not even having good connection within 5metres. Then within 30 days due to sweating it completely stopped working. I am still searching for the right wireless ear phone which can be used for long run, marathon and resist sweating.Very poor customer care service. I returned the product and have to wait for 3 week for dispatching a new one. Still on 4th week no shipment done.\\n', \"\\n  Hello I bought this product in big sale going on , got it for 1099 which is good deal.Later on it was for 2.5k don't buy at this price waste of money.Sound n bass is awesomeBattery not sure yetSongs can't be changed using music keys and music key functions are uncertainMusic starts playing from phone suddenly after the callDouble tapping of play/stop button dials last caller, which is greatest con of this product\\n\", \"\\n  It does the job well, pairs quickly,plays music and calls with decent clarity for the price it comes at. I feel like the CEO of a small startup pacing up up and down the hallway, with these plugged in while i take calls and act busy to avoid doing any real work.I just don't like that guy with the accent shouting YOU ARE CONNECTED TO NIRVANA and ADIOS AMIGO with such enthusiasm and that accent. Just a simple signature tune that's easy on the ears would've done the job to convey the action. Product team please consider this feedback while building your next set of devices.\\n\", '\\n  I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying \"your battery is low\" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won\\'t recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!\\n', '\\n  Product not working within 1 month from purchase\\n', '\\n  I have purchased the product on 7 Dec 2018 stopped working In Feb 2019, Reported it to boat, as per amazon, after a trial of email, the executive does not answer the call who was supposed to pick the product and drops a text that \"NO I AM NOT COMING\". I am left with faulty headphones now. What am I supposed to do with it.\\n', '\\n  Its not sweat proof that is clear it will malfunction when you run on treadmill wearing itSound is goodBattery is goodbut its not full sweatproofAlso will stop working after one month\\n', '\\n  Okiee.  After using it For one week i realized that there is chirp kind of noise when you change the video or. Change the song. ... This only the bad  side. Of this earphones Keeping this a side .Green color  looks fab. btw..The  sound quality is good.The battery life is amazing in 1 hours  it get fully charged.Upto 8 and 9 hours your  can listen music. Definitely go with this product .\\n', \"\\n  It is too bad..this ear phones could not completed even a month it has been only 20 days..and it's battery getting heated battery running time getting shorter by the time today it play only 1 hour ,next thing is it has been 5 days since it's one side earhone is not working..feeling cheated..\\n\", \"\\n  First of all. It is very comfortable. Doesn't fall from ear no matter how hard you shake head or dance.The sound is loud enough. Noise cancellation is awesome. Bass is good but sound signature is not so deep and quality sound you might expect. Treble is okay. Build quality seems very good it will last long. The magnetic strength is good and holds it secure.(not very good though)The bluetooth range is very good. Keeping it in the centre of my house(1800sq.ft) I can roam in the house freely without disconntions. And the bluetooth 5.0 offers dual pairing.It's micro usb, would have been game changer in this price if it was usb type C.Can't comment on battery life as it's my first day. And the fast charging is seens such a good feature.Thinking to test the IP rating🤣Bought yellow color but will go for the blue one.\\n\", \"\\n  I have earlier used two Boat earphones, and this was my third purchase.Packaging - great. It came in a box which includes extra eartips, manual, USB charger, earphones and a case.Sound quality - good at the price range. The bass is strong, good for edm.Bluetooth connectivity - good, both range wise and quick pairing. It has two device pairing. I earlier had connectivity issues between Lenovo devices and boat, none this time.Noise cancellation - decent.Fit - the earbuds aren't the most comfortable but shouldn't be any pain with moderate use. Also, it is unlikely to fall off with fast walk or jogging. However, the neckabamd seems flimsy.What I didn't like - I have never been a fan of neckband style earphones. And these looked ill fitted. The neckband and the wires are bigger than required.I didn't use it for the ill fitting so would have to cut the review short.\\n\", \"\\n  The unit stopped charging within months of purchase. Was replaced by boat in 10 days of complaint with a refurbished unit. The replacement provided was faulty with distortion of sound in one side and a 5 hour charge lasted for only 30 mins. Had to raise another complaint. Seems they don't do proper quality check before giving replacement. Will update on this basis the experience of the second complaint raised.\\n\", '\\n  Sound quality is good. noise cancellation is not upto the mark. battery quality is decent. by charging it once you can enjoy upto 5hrs of music without any issue\\n', \"\\n  The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.\\n\", '\\n  Sound quality is worst\\n', \"\\n  Product design is good and very durable. The best feature is the sound quality and its design. However what i didn't liked is the battery backup. Its up hardly for 3 to 4 hrs if continuously powered on which requires to be charged atleast 2x a day. Overall I would say , its a good deal only if its under 1K or max 1.2K inr.. otherwise I wont recommend it.\\n\", \"\\n  At first it's look good. While using sometimes it fell out of the ears. I have changed all the earbuds to suit my ears but it fell of when you are looking down.Now it's stopped left side. No tanglin nothing don't know how it stopped. Don't waste the money by buying cheap Bluetooth.I had a faith in boat because of their sound quality which they had in small budget earphones but this one is not worthyBass is medium not punchy for that bass  you can choose boat basshead  ₹599 its very good.\\n\", '\\n  I don\\'t usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don\\'t use it for like 3-4 hours. It\\'s very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don\\'t know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don\\'t know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it\\'s really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says \"Oops, battery low\". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it\\'s not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn\\'t last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.\\n', '\\n  I got it for INR999 and that\\'s the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you\\'ll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it\\'s a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it\\'s still running very strong though i don\\'t use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it\\'s earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don\\'t bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There\\'s no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for \" Audiophiles\" ,well if you are one , you won\\'t be looking at these anyway. So that\\'s it . Happy shopping.\\n', '\\n  Overall, a steal at this price range. It has that thumping bass factor which is missing these days in most of the midrange earphones. I have used both Realme wireless buds as well as this Boat Rockers 255 pro. Here is the comparison:Pros:1- For a bass lover like me, this earphone is better than the Realme buds. It has a nice thump feel.2- Fast charging. Gets fully charged in less than one hour.3- Earpieces are magnetic attached to each other. This gives a good grip around the neck.4- Wire is dust and sweat proof.5- Battery can last upto 10 hrs if used only for calls.Cons:1- On continuous music usage, battery lasted for around 6-7 hrs.2- Bluetooth auto-disconnect feature not present when the buds are stick together. This does impact the battery performance. Realme takes the advantage here.3- No USB-C support. No big deal.\\n', '\\n  Product STOPPED working in just 20 days useless even the 10 day return policy is over now no refund & waste of my hard earned money\\n', \"\\n  I bought this product after a long wait for drop in price for 1500 finally but just after few days of buying it for 1500, the price further dropped to 999! Really unhappy about having to spend 500 extra! Quality wise they're good but not exceptional. Also the eartips hooks are smaller than other branded earphones so not interchangeable with other earphones! I find it very inconvenient because my Sennheiser earphones have much better quality tips which I cannot fit on these as they fit lose.\\n\", \"\\n  Boat Rockerz 255 PRO @₹1299/-Review after using it for 15 daysAfter Battery low warning, fully charged in 30 minutes and whole day(4am to  10pm) battery backup (intermittent uses whole day or around 7-8 hours of regular use at 70% volume)Bass is quite good at 70%Superb at 90%Very clean soundMic is decent only catches human voice whether it's natural or recorded or TV ...No other noiseNo false remaining battery% showNo disconnection problem upto 20ftErgonomic design for regular useBut a Bit clumsy for running but we can adjust...I do use it for running purpose easily.

Amazon stop selling such substandard products plz.\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality is awesome.Noise cancellation is awesome.Building quality is amazing.Got it for 1299 in a deal.Worth the price.Connectivity is great.Can play pubg also just very minor lag in sound and that neglegable.Only con is the battery backup. It's not bad but it should be more then 6 hours.Similar option is the Sony c200 just a sightly high in price and you get 15 hours of backup.Other con is the Micro USB charging slot.Sony provides the USB type c charging slot.Rest all perfect at the price.\\n\", '\\n  Day 2 (Aug 12th 2019)I watched videos and listen to few songs. It did not hurt in ear. My purpose of buying them was for calls only. I do find them good. I checked with few people through Skype as well. It was good. It did last for more than 6 hours. When I received it was 100% charged. I started using it. Today the only challenge I saw was it was not connecting with my Bluetooth when it was left with 20% battery. I put it on charge. It recharged within the time of 1 hour or so.Date : August 17,  2019 - I am not music freak but the quality and sound is good for music. I majorly use it for my long day calls through Skype. In starting it was good, there were no issues. After few days I started facing connectivity issues. On 15th I was watching something or other whole day. I noticed that till the time I was using it the battery % was 100. I took a break and reconnected it was like 80%. This was the percentage after a regular play time of approx 3 hrs. Suddenly it started giving audio message ,oops and all that . The battery was showing 20% and it turned off at 20% battery. This was little upsetting for me. I requested for a replacement so I will be getting it on Aug 20, 2019.In this 1 year I have used 5 Bluetooth earphones. iBall, U8i, Samsung Muffspro and boAT. To give them a rank it will like this (Best at 5)1. Samsung2. iBall3. Muffspro4. U8iAnd the winner among them is boAT.This review is completely after using these mentioned headphones for more than 4 hour each day. The review is based on Battery,Sound Quality, Ease of talking on phone,  Ear comfort. All these products were under 3000 INR.The best part about boAT is quality, durability and battery. I might be buying an upgrade device of it soon.\\n', \"\\n  It was priced around 2.7K initially. But I definitely know it doesn't worth it. I got it in an offer for Rs.1.1K. Still it is not worth the price. I was just looking for some stuff, without having to plug in the 3.5mm jack to my mobile - and it serves that purpose. Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market\\n\", \"\\n  Just one month nd gone. Product sucks. Please don't buy. Not finding at service centres as well.\\n\", \"\\n  Honestly guys this product is good at its price. I bought this on 2nd January 2020. One side of it stopped working on June 2020. I called Support for a warranty they gave email/phone contact. I opened a ticket with Vendor and still did not get replacement/repair. Tried reaching vendor over the phone/email/ticket but no luck. Initially, they responded over ticket but from the last three weeks no update no answer. I finally contacted Support. They also initially responded positive but now no answers from them also. They(Support )  are asking for a denial letter for a refund. I don't understand when I am unable to contact ( given by Support) over email/ticket/phone how I can get the denial letter. Really disappointed with service from both vendor and Support support. So guys think twice before you buy this . All though  the product is nice, you will have nightmare for replacement/refund\\n\", '\\n  Writing this review after 1 week of use. I ordered this during lockdown period and Amazon delivered it on time with proper packing. Coming to the Rockerz 255 Pro headphone, this really work as it suppose to. I have all my Laptop and mobile having BT v 4.x and this this BT v5 headphone work perfectly. It will connect to the device immediately you switch it on. I use this for all my Teams and skype calls from office (WFH) along with mobile call during office time and this works perfectly. simultaneously it can connect with with one laptop and one mobile. Battery backup is also sufficient. really good purchase at this price range.\\n', \"\\n  Better in price range of 1399 best for use microphone quality is like wired headphone not only good for hearing music but also for talking with ur love ones at night.. best in all ur budget is under 1500 if ur budget is 4000 then go true wireless but in that u will miss the microphone quality u have to speak louder good for daily use bass is not best but okay type in this price range of wireless headphone neon and black colour is good all the three colours look awesome noise cancellation is not that much it fit properly u can use for gym heavy workout but due to neckband its little heavier and feeling of wired around neck as this is Bluetooth headset then not that much long lasting coz u have to charge the battery and one day after one year may the battery get damaged don't charge is frequently once its less than 20% than only charge this headphone battery backup of continues use in starting is 4 to 5hrs and at standby mode u can use it for 2days.. once u get this u will forget ur phone as whenever call will come u Don't have to run just use ur connected headset to receive the call . U can also pair smart watch and this headset together\\n\", '\\n  First impression:Just unpacked and pairing was very easy. I was able to pair this to my OnePlus 5T and Laptop. After pairing my phone first, I switched off the bluetooh in phone and paired with my PC. Then switched on the bluetooth in phone. Played music from PC and when I received a call in my phone, the headset goes silent and the music automatically pauses. Exactly the way I wanted. However, one drawback is that when the phone call ends, the music doesnt resume automatically.Sound Quality is good - Good bass - Comfortable to wearSuggestion for the manufacturer:As soon as the device is paired, not sure why the voice says \"You plugged into Nirvana\"?And instead of referring the connected device name, the headphone voice says \"You are connected to Boat Rockerz\".. Shouldnt this be the name of the connected device..(Mobile name or the laptop name)?\\n', \"\\n  CONS--1299 INR--NOISE CANCELLATIONBATTERY LIFE IS OK AS MENTIONED 7-8 HOURSCONS--HEAVY ON BASS(I HAVE USED SENNHEISER, SKULLCANDY AND PIXEL BUDS IN PAST SO I KNOW SOUND QUALITY)-- NO STANDARD BALCK COLOR (YELLOW RED DOESN'T SUIT PROFESSIONAL) NEITHER GEERN ONE.\\n\", '\\n  I had bought the earphones about 20 days back. They were working absolutely fine. They fit perfectly and sound great.But after 20 days of working they stopped working. They wont switch on. I tried charging with powerbanks, PC, chargers (I was very careful of not exceeding the amperage for charging and I didnt exceed the limit). Now to claim warranty I have to send this to the company which will take at least 10-15 days. This is very unfortunate and I am seriously questioning the legitimacy of this brand.\\n', '\\n  ** the product was a perfect purchase... but it is not charging, requested for replacement..Replacement is quick and so prominent...

If you are normal  gamer than it is good.\\n\", '\\n  Bought this product in mid january  2019 Second bought in may 2019. After almost 8 mnth of usage( first one), happy to give my reviews for this product.Got the product at 999/- in lighting sale on amazon on sankrant offer. delivery withing 2 days . product arrived in a very good impressive box with proper hard casing to product from damage. Amazon shipped the product in proper safe packaging.  Over all product plastic built quality is strong,feel of the headset is smooth . Comes in 3 colours namely red/black , green/black and full black.Coming to pros and con of the productPros1. light weight , wont feel and pain around neck for prolonged usage2. large battery for almost 2 days usage3. clear crisper ear phones sound, adequate bass and treble,  for more effect use mobile equaliser.4. 3 types of ear buds provided for different ear size.5. fits well in ears with in ear loop to keep them in position while jogging, the loops don let the ear buds to fall.6. loud sound with volume up/down buttons, multifunction power buttons act as power on/off, single click for calls receive / hangup option double click to call last dialed number, , long press volume up / down to change songs, single click volume buttons to change volume.7. Coming to connectivety, trust me it connects to mobile bluetooth within 15 seconds. easy first time pairing,Keep the power button pressed for 5 or more secs, the indicator light blinks red and blue meand its in pairing mode , start searching the bluetooth in mobile select one u see the name boat rockers and voila ur now connected.the voice commond will speak that its connected.8. voice prompt in the bluetooth headset have 5 commands , power on, power off, ur now connected and battery low and incoming call alert.9. yes its say noice cancellation and its works flawless. clear sound to opp party in event of loud background noises during calls.10. range of bluetooth is good i tested for 20 feet in house.11. charging cable is provided, no charger.12. Also service center is really good but just little slow.headset got malfunctioning in 6th month , raised an online complain on the website mentioned, got complain no. withing few min of form filling , next day bluedart courier person came to pick the headset, withing 10 days after the complain new headset is deliverred via bluedart .Now few cons1. wires for the headset is quite long so its is hard to handle during transit in crowded public transport,2. the ear bugs tend to fall off during corwded public travelling so be careful.3. during summer wearing it will create little discomfort  due to sweat so just be careful, sweat can slide and damage the  product.Thats it overall a really trust worthy brand with a strong durable build quality and longer lifeline.Buy it without second thought.This is my 3rd purchase and all 3 still working till today (review edit date.11/01/2020)\\n', '\\n  I purchased this product for 999/- and received it one day (Thanks to Amazon). I am going to split the review about this product into PROS and CONS.PROS:1). Sound quality - As i am a bass lover, I have satisfied with the sound stage of this device. Lows and mids are clear with an adequate amount of bass.2). Build quality - Build quality of the product is exceptionally great for this price and it has two magnets which holds the ear pieces in place.3). Sweat proof - Suitable for gym freaks. It can easily withstand the splashes and sweat since it has IP rating.4). Battery life - This product can last for 6 to 8 hours depending on your usage. Charging time takes around 45 minutes to reach 100%CONS:1). Connectivity - Bluetooth range is not that great. After moving 5 meters away from the device, the connectivity gets lost. So, mostly make sure that you carry your mobile along with you and the battery information about the device is not appropriate. Some times it shows 80% in my device and all of a sudden it indicates 20% battery remaining.2). Tactility - Buttons on this headphones are not that easy to press. It needs some hard presses which sometimes feel irritated.So, if you are a good bass lover and looking for a good wireless earphones at an affordable price then this should be your choice probably.\\n', '\\n  While the quality is good, sometimes party on the other end of the call are not able to hear us. Also the external noise while is motion is high than our voice. Good for hearing songs but not for handling calls...After 6 months of usage....one side wire got tampered and no connectivity to one side now.....very disappointed.\\n', \"\\n  Sound quality is good also the call quality. But i am facing a weird problem while zoom video call. Intermittently its getting disconnected and then automatically connected. Video also gets stuck and sound becomes cracking. This doesn't occur if i disconnect from Bluetooth. Also i found one more situation when it does have the same issue while watching videos on YouTube. The moment you connect Bluetooth all the following videos get stuck and the moment you disconnect all the following videos appear. I am planning to return this product. Above are the most basic requirement if it doesn't fulfill then there is no point to keep this product. May be it was a faulty or refurbished product. I would have definitely given 5 star otherwise as sound and call quality is great.\\n\", '\\n  Really like the base and sound quality for this price. It\\'s good to listen to music. I have a Bose 300 QC but I\\'m using this on a day to day basis as carrying QC wherever I go is not practical. I going this headphone is  quite enough for my music need . The microphone is working as expected.The only issue is that the headphone doesnt announce the battery percentage. However my OnePlus 6t shows headphone battery when connected. The headphone give the annoying message \"battery is low\" from 20% onwards.\\n', '\\n  Product received on time there is no issue.  Sharing my experience here for you to decide before you go for this product only.During calls suddenly it goes blank.There is no noise cancellation or its not working properly.  Always people on call ask me \"are you outside, we are getting so many noise\"I have ordered replacement, after 15 days i received serviced item (may be before that someone used and returned to boat), Same issue persist but now I don\\'t know what to do... and I am not using this for important office calls.  Just using for hearing music & watching movies.  Replacement process is good, they only come and collect your product and return using courier, if you raise ticket online.  Problem rectified or not that\\'s matter.Overall my suggestion / experience I could say \"Don\\'t go for this product if you really want to use it for official purpose\"\\n', '\\n  I’ve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.6. Poor Battery level indicator: if the battery level is full, then you’d be rest assured that you’ll have battery power for 2-3 hrs.If the level is less than full e.g 80-90%, you can expect battery to run out in around 2 hrs.So, the battery level indicator is not true indicator of actual battery level. Which means, you always keep it 100% charged if you don’t wanna risk running out of battery.\\n', '\\n  Pros:charge time 2 hrs and backup is very good full day use (6 hr continuous)two led colors red and blue . while using blue light blinks after every few secs,in-build ringtone (trrrin trrrin type).using in honor 6x show battery icon in 100-80-50-25-0 stages.Gives warning on low battery and when connected or disconnected (human voice).Lightwight,good build quality.i replaced rubber earplugs with piston earphone plugs, the 3 pairs comes with package are not too soft but are fine.you can control volume of pc and mobile depends on which device is currently playing.i am using piston onemore ,music quality is not to that level but is pretty decent. bass is balancedcons:Range is 10m in real world plays well if u are in room , the moment you walk out of room then distortion occurs.mic is very sensitive and works fine so far no complains from other end. i have not used outside the room.when it keep it for charging it gets switch off on it own then have to reconnect it again (not a big issue) ....first i had doubt on it battery,sound quality,mic quality but after using it i am happy even though i have used one more ,boat 255,mi earphone 399 , Samsung earphone, Phillips 249 etc.\\n', '\\n  I bought these earphones on 23 March. My experience with these headphones is quite great. I got delivery on time, packing was great and sealed. So talking about functioning- it comes with the sound quality you will love. Bass is good enough to make your toes move. Mic is of good quality, Noise cancellation could have been even better but I think thats great for this price range. Works with dual phone and for for about 7-8m radius. Battery backup is good. Though it has 10 min charge system, full battery charging takes time. Buttons are working well. Build quality is superb. In short you can go for it if you are thinking to buy it.\\n', '\\n  Still struggling to get through the customer care of Boat! Which is virtually non existent. Whenever I get to talk to their customer support all they do is promise that they are working on it and never get back. I would recommend to go for products which has a decent after sales service. Boat is proving to be the typical use and throw China product!\\n', '\\n  After 3  months  right  one of  headphone  is  stop working  if  yu  loved  to run then  it is  not  for you  it  will fall  easily when yu  go  for  a walk  very  bad  Quality Wasted  my 1499rs  customer  is  not  receiving my  calls  they said  we will  help you bt  they didnt\\n', '\\n  Looks bad,not stylishVery uncomfortable,Sound also not goodI don’t know about other products at this priceBetter don’t bye this productNo need to go for other reviews if u saw my reviewI can’t return this item because there is only replace option\\n', \"\\n  Within 1 year, one side of earphone  wasn't working and then suddenly other side also not working. I raised issue to service center and they allotted one courier guy. They took away my products and then suddenly canceled my service related request. Now both courier service and BOAT company says that my shipment was cancelled and they don't have my product.The issue of BOAT headphones is too frequent with other customers that the company has to separately create one complaint registration format as you can see in the image. There are thousand of customer who have registered their complaint on the site. Theses are specific pattern of issues that frequently customers get.\\n\", '\\n  Awesome best budget wireless earphones\\n', \"\\n  Bought this 4 months back.Pros- good sound, nice battery back, very light on neck.  Good only for listening to musicCons - really bad for using it for its actual purpose. It has got no noise cancellation hence people will nt be able to hear you clearly.My advice avoid buying it as you can't return it\\n\", \"\\n  Nice product. I love it's sound and bass. I purchased for me and another two for my family members after I make sure for it's sound quality. But one thing I really concerned here about it build quality. Mine replaced for two times till now for it's power button issue. It will take 20 days to replace the product. First time after 20 days of purchaseing and then after three months. Now they clame this new replacement is a good one. Let's see how many days it will again goes.\\n\", '\\n  I made my choice based on the boat headphones with cable I have purchased in the past. But as compared to them, the noise reduction is really poor. in fact, it picks up more noise from the background. the person at another end can hear the bump sound of the car in a pothole while driving.These are not good if you are planning to use for official calls.Bass is TOO high. Bass as high sound good for metal or Jazz music, but in these headphones, it suppresses the other instruments.Fit in the ear is good and battery life is also as mentioned.\\n', '\\n  Dont go for this product. I have seen the reviews and purchased it but to my surprise, the ear phones are very bad at producing the decent bass,instead the bass is too heavy that even a bass head like me does not find it good. Too heavy to use it for longer times, u might end up hurting ur ears.\\n', \"\\n  Reviewing after 5 months of use.Pros:1-Sound quality is awesome.2- You don't need to take your phone everywhere.3- You look AMEER.Cons.I will tell you sone cons that no one ever told you.1- That curved supporter which stuck in Pinna (part of ear) to provide more balance, start hurting in just 30 mnts. You have to use earphone without that.2- Every size of earbuds hurt your ear from inside.3- One side of earphone stopped working in 4 months and replacement process takes about 25-30 days.4- This is not only me who suffered this problem, all my friend who bought this product have replaced it atleast once in 5 months.5- USB cable which is provided with this product stopped working in 2 months.6- Ameer dikhoge to dost Party mangenge.\\n\", \"\\n  Boat makes good quality Audio products and this wireless set is no exception.

To be honest, wrt sound quality, this Boat one is far behind all of them except MI basic & Byte Corseca where it's equivalent.The reason being, you can't get everything at such a low price point. If you want good quality in-ear wireless experience to be ready to shell out more.Every product category has a minimum price value required for impressive performance. Below that value, compromises need to be made.P.S. Battery backup is not an issue owing to the form factor. It's comparable to BH 505 and ranges around 5-6 hours.

I have been using it for 4-5 months and so far didn't face any issue.▶ If you can increase your budget go for JBL -> Sony -> Senheisser (increasing order of price and sound quality)▶ BUT if you are not obsessed with wireless functionality or you can avoid this wireless part, better invest that amount in wired in-ear earphones (over the ear will require further investment) as for the same amount you will get astounding sound quality.\\n\", '\\n  Guys if you are looking for perfect sound then go for it. Even on 70% of the sound you are deaf for other sound. 100% sound no disturbance in music.Call quality is good with phone (bit less, opposite person hear very less soundHowever, on other calling app (office) laptop connection microphone is not that powerful, a person on other end will hear very less of us.Connectivity is awesome as I connected with my phone (Redmi note 9 pro) as well as Lenovo laptop.Jumping from phone to laptop or laptop to phone it is so quick.Very crispy sound with impacted bass. If you looking for calling then I should not suggest this\\n', \"\\n  I have bought this earphone once , replaced once and finally about to get refund after i returned it second time. Thanks Amazon and seller for initiating the refund. I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.Pros:1. BASS, really heavy bass.2. while listening to music, Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.5. Neck design if u like it.6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.Cons:1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, MIC noiseless,Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.CHEERS!!!\\n\", '\\n  I tried 3 bluetooth headsets (Samsung Level U which is not so durable, 2 of JBL) and boat rockerz255 is the best pick i must say considering the pricing (bought is for 999, i know you can get it at even better price sometimes). Steady, Durable and Decent Quality of music. Recommended for Bikers, Cyclists, who want decent music and wireless headsets. Someone like music geek or who is looking for bass, amazing music this may not be good pick though. \"Thank You Boat\", you are one among few Indian companies which has flourished in recent past, please continue making good products and make us feel proud.\\n', \"\\n  Good for a few weeks. After that the battery heated up drastically, and melted the rubber buttons. I luckily stopped charging in time, else may have even caught fire. Now the buttons are fused and the product can't be used.Hope Amazon will promptly replace the defective product.\\n\", '\\n  Super Bass is like \"Baby Ko Base Pasand Hai\". Good sound quality. Noice cancellation is Okay. Fits perfectly with in-ear buds and ear lock holds firm while sports activities. You can remove those ear lock silicon holders if not running or sports activities. It\\'s optional, it depends upon one\\'s usage For a cool nifty tip use a paper clip to hold the plug wires firmly togather while excercises like pushups, crunches. It is likely to fall off your neck if you do these exercises. I hope in next version of this ear heads the company will notice it for it\\'s boAtHeads fans. View my uploaded pics for details.\\n', '\\n  after using it for 4 weeks it has stopped working very disappointed. After service of this product is also horrible i will defiantly not recommend this product horrible horrible experience all the money gone into waste:(never recommending your company to any one you guys are worst for sure\\n', \"\\n  When connected to my cellphone (galaxy s9) it would show battery 80%. Exactly 80%, not less or more than 80. It would show battery to be 80% even if the battery is down and suddenly after using for 1 hour it would come down 20% and at that point it would say that battery is low. But it would keep saying low battery until it's shut down. Even if you can listen to a 3 min. song in low battery, it would keep saying low battery in between the song .Got it for 1100 rs. so cannot complain a lot.Thanks !\\n\", '\\n  October 5, 2020: First impressions► The device did not power on; made me think it might have been shipped without any charge in its battery. I charged it for ten minutes and was then able to power it on. Once connected to my phone, it said the battery was at 80%. That was a bit confusing.► I played→ soft piano music→ ghazals→ old and recent Bollywood songs→ techno, pop, and jazz→ debates and mushaira.The device performs quite well. The bass is good as advertised, music and voice are clear. I am satisfied.► I have not yet tried voice calls with the device. I don\\'t spend much time on phone calls, so the call quality does not matter to me much.►Looks and build are OK.► Earbuds are soft and well-fitting. However, that does not mean they will feel comfortable for everyone. The same is true with all wearable devices.►THE ONLY THING I HATE SO FAR: The annoying pre-recorded message you hear in a loud male voice upon powering on, connecting and power off the device. Quite annoying. Check out what it says:When you power on the earphones: \"Power on! You have plugged into Nirvana. Your device is ready to pair.\"When you connect to a phone or laptop: \"You\\'re now connected to Rocerz 255 Pro!When you post off: \"Adios, amigo! Powering off.\"Trust me, you will feel irritated listening to all that every time.Before buying BoAt Rockerz 255 Pro, I considered One Plus Bullets Z, Realme Buds, Lenovo HE15, and Boult Audio ProBass. I verified the accuracy of reviews for all these devices and checked for the possible deception involved. I found that the reviews for BoAt Rockerz 255 Pro were much more reliable. (You can use FakeSpot for verifying the authenticity of the reviews)\\n', '\\n  Waste of Money , Stop functioning within 1 month .After charging Also power not on .* Water / Sweat resistant function is Fake .* Fast charging is good but long battery back is just joke .* Amazon not ready for exchange and Service Centers are closed .I am just cheated by this product .\\n', \"\\n  Too much of Bass. Even if you listen to a Coke Studio music or Trance or heavy metal, It's the same sound. No difference. You can't go next with music control. When you are driving or riding you can't change song. I don't know why people are giving such good reviews. Don't know for what goodness. Just because of noise cancellation. Or they don't know the tase of Pure music.

The connectivity is really, really bad though. It connects really bad through a body so basically, if you are wearing some clothing layers and its in a backpack, connection drops. Even in a running arm band on the same side as receiver, the connection is lost a lot of times as it stutters. Place 1 finger over the receiver (the bony part of finger) and connection drops. It doesn't even have good connectivity for 10 cm much less 10 m.If all you've done is used out of the box or cheapo chinese ubon headphones, these will be adequate but if you've ever paid for set of headphones before, this ain't it for you fam\\n\", \"\\n  Worth buying this product if you have a limitted budget of 1.5 KJust to note this earphone comes with bluetooth v 4.1 and CSR 8635 chipset, but there is a confusion with amazon itself... in desc its mentioned 4.1 however in pictures its shown as 4.2.. The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!! Customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.Talking about build quality, sound clarity and looksI personally liked it.. Bass is really good no noise while hearing. If you are listening into a good melody songs you would dive into the music. Look wise as depicted in pictures it looks different from the black and red..I use for jogging and excersise and the fit is good.. it won't get dropped off.Battery is ok I am getting around 6 hrs in a one full charge. Battery capacity could have been increased at least to 10 hrs by Boat. But no worries...\\n\", \"\\n  Just bought this a month back. It's not working now. It's not getting connected to any device.  I never thought they will sell such a cheap product with a high cost. I'd it really from boat brand?

When there was a problem with the product, we are to register our complaint as per method indicated in policy terms since more than a month now, but could not register till date. Instead of complaint being registered, each time a phone number popped up, which is surprisingly NON OPERATIONAL. We could not even talk their customercare number as it had an indefinite waiting time . Thereafter we tried to get in touch with them through Instagram, facebook and twitter, but to our surprise they just did not respond even then. Each time they simply asked for our number but never reverted back. It seems that they are simply waiting for the warranty to expire so that they can thereafter be free from the obligation of  honouring the warranty.

Product quality is decent. Sound quality is good. Works perfectly as an in-ear headphone, as you won't hear much outside noise or even outside sounds once you're plugged in.2. You will hear audio assists when you switch it on, pair it to Bluetooth, switch off etc. That is a good feature.3. Placement of the earpiece is problematic. I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4.

But I can hear both voices 1 is the person who speaking to me and on background I can hear songs....that is the worest part with this earphone....Over all my opinion is to go with any other earphone with little more budjet (JBL ).\\n', '\\n  It is probably one of the worst bluetooth headphones available in the market. and this i am saying based on my personal experience.Apart from Bluetooth connectivity & Bass Quality issues, one of the major defect is that it is not at all sweat proof as being advertised.& since it is not sweat proof it stops working abruptly anytime in between workout & becomes dead for an extended period of time plus in my case speaker functionality completely stopped working within the first 2 months of purchase.I would strongly recommend not to buy this product if you are looking for a decent sports bluetooth headphones.\\n', \"\\n  Edit: Mike stopped working after 20 days, so cannot use it for calls anymore. The return window has also closed. DO NOT BUY.Since I don't use it for music, this review is about all the OTHER aspects of it. Overall, not a bad purchase if you're a non-fussy buyer who just wants a bluetooth headset that works, needs it for clocking less than 6 hours of use per day and doesn't care about how it looks.What I liked:1. It's light and comfortable to wear.2. Sounds are clear while on call or playing videos.3. Can stay connected and alternate between two devices at a time, so I don't have to repeat the pairing process between my laptop and phone.What I did not like:1. I got the ocean blue one which looked shiny and bright in the product ad, but the colour is actually a dull matte light blue.2. Bluetooth range is less than 10 metres3. Active playback time is only 6 hours after 1.5 hours of charging.4. The ear guide is not comfortable for long periods, but the earphones also keep falling out of the ear when guides are removed.5. Looks cheap. Plastic buttons have rough edges and wires are not smooth.6. Wires are too long, hanging all the way to the tummy when not in use. There is no provision to adjust cord length.\\n\", '\\n  I am not sure on people commenting no deep bass...but it works perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy A50 and Sony Xperia XA Ultra....tried on stock music app (brand provided)  and third party music app its just awsome bass...high and low nodes are too perfect...got at 899 in offer...build quality is also good...and button placement makes easy to use...all control on the buttons...\\n', '\\n  I had bought this earphone for my brother for his office use. Below are experiences:1> The noise cancellation is quite good.2> the voice quality is also great. I can hear people well and they can hear me well.3> The band is light weight and do not feel like a weight on my neck.4> Good to hear songs while running. The sweat do not affect the band.5> The talk time is superb and covers my office time. With one full charge it can go for 10-12 hours.All I can say is I am happy with the product and I recommend you to buy this product if need be without any doubt.\\n', '\\n  I usually don’t write a review but felt the urge to mention the very unprofessional after sales service support so as to affect purchasing decisions.Usually i buy a electronic product after thorough research on the specifications, product reviews, price etc. BUT WE TOO NEED TO WEIGH THE AFTER SALES SERVICE.I had a problem of charging my earphones after 10 months of use within the stipulated warranty period of 1 year.Next I tried their Customer Care number but there is no online or on phone registration facility of the complaint! They send a sms link to register but the link doesn’t open (see pictures)!!Next I sought their service centre in my city Ahmedabad and found a single centre for the whole city some 10-11kms away. I reached the centre to be totally disappointed with the centre which was a small shop size with no parking. They checked and found the problem to be due to water damage to the charging point. Even though never has my earphones touched water, I accepted that and asked for the solution, but then the twist started!They refused to repair it even on payment basis - reason that they were just there to replace the piece if it was a manufacturer defect. They genuinely were not their for any repair work.They asked me to talk with the call centre executive to find the repair solution but the call could not be connected to the executive in spite of 20mins of waiting. I am trying to talk with the company for last 48 hours but every time the recorded voice assures me that My call is going to be connected in short time but no success.In short I feel that I will have to ditch the 1100/- rs product for just unable to get a customer paid repair.The thing I disliked is that in today’s smart world the boat customer website is not taking an online or telephonic complaint and you can not talk to the executive.VERDICT: I will definitely avoid BOAT products in future in spite of attractive Branding and cheap prices due to a very lazy service system.\\n', \"\\n  Well i used boat products before they are good as they were before.pros - base is good , water resistant ( here doscription says IPx4 but my earphone box says IPx5, and that is even better , you should update your product description. ) , Magnet lock , design .Con - cable is a bit long. As it has control box both side and a little hard cable at back, the remaining cable shouldn't be this long.Above all its a good product. Recommend to all the people who wants to buy a cheap but best wireless earphone.\\n\", '\\n  Writing this review while listening to music with this awesome earphone. Got this in prime day sale in just 999/- which itself is a great deal. I have used Boat basshead 225 earphone and Boat rockers 400 earlier but this is better than both of them. Comfortable, lightweight, superb bass, great noise cancellation, no issue with pairing with my Android device.  Sound clarity is ok. I will review it again after a month of use.\\n', '\\n  Generally Boat quality is good but for this product i think it\\'s patheticPoints:1. For voice call for initial few second(around 40sec to 1 min) the voice is distorted and the other party is not able to hear you, and in between also this problem occurs randomly.2. They claim connectivity with 2 device simultaneously , but it get disconnected in between.3. Sound quality is normal I have used \"Boult Audio ProBass\" and i can say that sound quality of Boult is more aggressive specially with bass.4. Seriously not worth spending 1600.5. Build quality is good.6. Want refund for this product.\\n', \"\\n  I got a different colour than what I ordered, blazing yellow would have been awesome but it wasn't. Rest everything is great about this.Also to mention, there is sound latency in PUBG (and yes there will be some latency in Bluetooth device) I read reviews claiming no sound latency ( please do get misguided, if you have used good wireless headphones in past, you would easily notice the latency).Bass is too good(compared to other headphones I used in this price range)It's much better than boat 400 wireless, 390, 900(comparing overall and all the aspects)One full charge would last a whole day.Sadly I returned it because of the colour and latency in PUBG as I have boat 510 too(I would have kept it too if latency and colour issue wouldn't be there).Overall a Greta product to go after. Just too good\\n\", \"\\n  Hey Amazon read carefully, I will give it only 1 star after using 10 months because there is worst customer service ever by boat rockerz company. I had 1 year replacement warranty but they were not giving me answer properly for replacing my faulty unit. Worst service and you Amazon selling worst units like this.Worst service. Really I become very annoyed in replacing this product.Also my prime subscription going to over of Amazon that I'm not renewing now.Clear message. Help and support customers or ready to suffer.\\n\", \"\\n  Bass lovers .........Will love this. Boat rockerz is truly for bass lovers with wireless it's giving tremendous sound quality........ Go for it.....Giving 4 star only for delivering used headphone to me getting replacement this week...... Otherwise this is better wireless than sony and senhiser which are more costlier than this.....If don't want to spend more than just go for it. Will update as I will receive new one and tell you about build quality and looks....Also share pics. Replacement is faulty and seller is not giving me replacement of  headphone again so returning the same.\\n\", \"\\n  I'm writing this review after using these earphones for quite sometime. I don't use earphones regularly and I keep them very safe. First of all, it stopped working all of a sudden in like 4 months, it neither started on clicking the power button nor charged up. Secondly, the battery time was horrible, even after full charge it barely worked for 3 hours. Regarding the sound, it was average just like any other earphone so I was sort of okay with it, though noise cancellation did not work. (Bass was a bit better) Even the customer service is quite frustrating and I couldn't get my replace till now even after so many days of complaint.Overall I would say it's an overhyped product, price wise okay but then it's better to invest in a quality product than just changing it often.\\n\", \"\\n  EDIT, After using it for 2 weeks I'll say you honestly what I witness,1- Sound is not that much, earphone is not that loud.. you'll find a normal wired earphone many times louder.2- If you're using it to listen music, bass to be precise.. this is not for you, because this has very low bass compared to basshead 152,182,102 or any other good wired earphones.3- it's ideal for receiving calls and stuff, but I don't think wireless earphones looks good.4- I have been using it for 2 weeks and the problem I face is that if you use this earphones over watching High quality videos.. video will play properly but audio will buffer so much like we're steaming a video on 2g net.I have a 50 Mbps wifi, I'm using this earphones with realme X2 pro which has bluetooth 5.. and just head on YouTube stream anything select quality to 720p or above and video will smoothly but audio will buffer so much. So I brought my all earphones, selected quality of video to 1080p and used all earphones and my one wireless ptron earphone everything worked fine just I connected this with my phone, audio started lagging. At one time this earphone was connected to only my phone and my phone was only connected to this earphones but still idk what's the issue.\\n\", \"\\n  This is the first product ever where I have given a full 5 star rating. To start with, I read a lot of pro's & con's for this product & understand that most people rate products more as per their expectations than actually the quality of the product. This product covers all areas, i.e. Looks, Performance & Sound Quality. I know 4 hours of battery life (listening to music) on full charging lowers people's expectations but it's still worth the quality of sound this product delivers. If you are a EDM fan, then this product gives you a live discotheque feeling around. I am completely satisfied purchasing this product & I can suggest anyone buying this product 100%. JUST BUY IT Specially when there is a PRIME USER Discount Sale On!!!!\\n\", '\\n  Headphone is average but most important thing in todays era is after sale service on this side this brand is pathetic dont go for it at all.I have used other headphone brands in past but never have faced such ridiculous service.I have given my boat headphone around 2month back fr issue related to one side not working...which is usual as sometime it happens....but till now i have not got my device back yet after several mails on diffrnt customore care boat mail id. I think this brand is just focusing on selling but not on after sale service which is very crucial. Brands in todays date are so much concern on after sale service as am using other diffrnt..So pls dnt go fr this brand...i would suggest go for any branded company which is more committed.\\n', '\\n  I have been using the product for the last few months and I am surprised by its battery life. It can be used for 6+ hours continuously on a single charge. The connection is smooth and the mic works great. I bought it for calling purposes so I am happy with the product but since I have used JBL and BOSE in the past so the quality of sound and bass is slightly low. However, for the price which I got, it was a steal.\\n', \"\\n  I wanted a set of Bluetooth headphones that I can use at work, as well as while exercising. I have found it to be quite decent.Pros:* Can connect to 2 devices at the same time.* The ear bud provide good sound isolation, and reduce background noise to a large extent.* The microphone is quite good, and none of the people I spoke on the phone with, could recognize that I was on a heaset.* The earbuds don't come out, no matter how much I shake my head, or move around. (Important while exercising)* They are light and comfortable enough to wear while sleeping, and having your head on the side.Cons:* If you wear it while running/jogging, the neckband keeps jumping. Would have loved some magnetic clasp on the neck which would prevent it from jumping out.* When the battery is down, it just gives a warning and shuts down; Would have loved it, if it could have a warning at say 20%, so that you can decide what to do after that.\\n\", '\\n  Average Product* LikesGreat battery lifeDurableMagnetized budsFast charging* DislikesAt high volume sound becomes noisyRight side speaker stopped working after 10 months of usage.Unavailability of service centers at major cities.I have been a fan of boat products. Used boat earphone, Bluetooth headphone, Sound bar as well but this time got very dissatisfied with Boat Rockerz 255. Donot recommended at all\\n', \"\\n  Actually I was going to buy and wanted a bass supported and I choose it but after getting this I feel much only bass...so it's like something different..not amazing in listing any song... due to too much bass the quality of sound is destroyed..but one thing is appreciated and this is the duel connection option with two android phone..but I have a JBL but there is no this facility...neck band is good it's not moving anywhere... since I am facing this issue in my JBL..\\n\", \"\\n  This product is average in sound and built quality. 3.5/5.It comes up with good boat packaging and additional set of earbuds rubber in different sizes similar to other products. However 'Rockerz' branding is missing which is not big deal.Previously i have used sony, nokia, skullcandyand  JBL bluetooth headphones, so its difficult for me to lower down with boat. If you want to listen music then its good option. Little Bass is present.Controller buttons plastic plate length is little extra compare to other headphones. LED indicator is tiny and not continously available. Additional rubber curve above earbuds are good for little additional grip.Considering lower price in segment, this product is okay. If budget is your priority or if its your first try with Bluetooth then blindly go for this. It will not put you down.Cheers, Ashutosh\\n\", \"\\n  I have further reduced it to 2 stars as there is connectivity issues. While listening to music it suddenly disconnects and connects .... Sometimes it does not connect at all ...  then i have to re-pair the device as a new deviceThe first product i received did not have the mic wokring and the sound quality was very bad especially in one year the sound was higher than the other one. The replacement i got is working fine. The only problem i notice is when i am walking the connectivity seems to be patchy. The song starts breaking up but after sometime it's ok. I notice this when i go for more than an hour of walking. I have both the boat and realme earphone both have their advantages, personally i like the realme slightly more than boat\\n\", \"\\n  This is an average bluetooth headset and serves the purpose. And justifies the cost. Many of the music components are unvalued and heigher frequency sounds quality are suffering. Most focus on 20 HZ to 500HZ I guess.But if you are music lover and and can't compromise with the quality the spend bit extra please better do it or go for. I used Sennheiser for five years and dropping to this headset is kind of shocking and learning to adjust.\\n\", \"\\n  Wrote a much longer review but the page reset so I am not re-typing- The bass was good (bass lovers might enjoy it..) but a bit too high/heavy for my liking and so it tends to drown out/reduce the clarity of other instruments and the vocals at times too. Similar to the MDR and XB Sony ranges as far as the bass and overall output goes. The battery life is decent at about 6 hours listening at 70-80% + of the max volume. The wireless range was also decent and can be put at approximately 15 feet max - but with say two walls in between (so it might be a little more minus the walls..). The magnetic lock seems to work just fine, have not really tested the microphone much- the widened neckband is great and gives the earphones stability on the neck. My main issue came down to the life span of the product- I thought the build quality and durability was above average but then this happened- Bought this a few months ago but I left it pretty much sealed and untouched in its box (I continued to use my Apple and Skullcandy wired earphones-the sound quality on the Apple pods is still brilliant so I still use the wired ones over wireless earphones whenever possible/not too inconvenient) - so I only started to use the Boat earphones a month or two ago and well- the left earpiece is already malfunctioning and had almost stopped outputting any audible sound on a few occasions now. I did tend to use the earphones at 80% plus of the max volume but if that is the cause for failure then the earphones obviously are not engineered as well as claimed. Now the volume of the left earpiece is softer and less clear than the right- and has faded away completely on occasions that I have tried to listen to music for a stretch of about 4 hours on 80% volume or such- I am just trying to keep the volume low at the moment so that the earpiece does not stop emitting sound completely again- will have no choice but to get in touch with their customer service if the issue persists and see what they say- but the only conclusion I can draw from my experience thus far is that these earphones lack even say Skullcandy's durability which at least use to last almost a year even when used for long stretches of time at about 80-90% of the upper volume limit for music etc.\\n\", \"\\n  I bought one recently and below was my experience :1) the wireless range is very low.2) battery life isn't good either.3) boat is known for it's bass, but this one's bass was terribly unpleasant.Final verdict : Don't buy it. Better go for Mi sports basic headsets that 's much better and has a balanced sound. Or if you have a good budget, go with the Jays t-Four or RHA, they are just WOW!!\\n\", '\\n  Cons:1. Audio sync issue in online videos after being interrupted with a call. You need to disconnect and connect again for getting proper sync.2. Noise cancellation in call is not upto the mark, people at other end hearing all sounds.3. My Mobile battery is draining fast after I start using this. Did not face this issue with other BT headsets.Pros:1. Audio quality is good.2. Fast charging really works. 10min charge giving nearly 3 hrs continious playback.3. Can pair and connect to multiple devices simultaneously. This really helps to those who watches videos on PC and attend calls from phone.\\n', \"\\n  I love these Earphones.My battery lasted from morning 6:40 am to 11pm where it was continuously connected to my smartphone. I used it for calls and for1 hour for music in this time period.There's a lot of Bass. This can be levelled with your smart phone's inbuilt equalizer, but it will be a pain if you are using multiple music players or video players.The build quality is good w.r.t. the price. I bought it for Rs. 1399/-.Bluetooth pairing is very fast. No hazzles.It can be used for all activities but not voice recording. So if anyone is looking out for recording audio with this device then this is not at all what you are looking for.\\n\", \"\\n  Don't go by the reviews. I ordered two and both of them stopped working in a month I raised the query and got picked up. I am still waiting for the replacement after 4 months. Tried calling customer care and write several mails but of no use. These are also made in China just when they realised the wave against Chinese products they claim made in India but the origin is Made in China. Note that\\n\", \"\\n  Before stating it's pros and cons, I would like to say that I've used Sennheiser Cx180 before this which just broke down after satisfactory use of more than 2 yrs. So I'll be comparing sound quality of this with that.*Pros*→ Lightweight→ Superb sound quality→ Attractive & durable design→ Good Battery life→ Google assistant/Siri→ Tangle free wire with magnetic heads→ Sweat proof*Cons*→ Though Bass is awesome, you can find a bit compromise in mids & high, but you won't be able to notice this unless you compare it with some high end headphones.→ Slight pain in ear if you wear it for long.*Overall verdict*9/10Just go for it if you want Bluetooth headphones for ₹1.5k, you are not getting any better than this.[ EDIT:After using about 7 months one side of earphone stopped working. So I raised a ticket for warranty and also they were able to pickup my product, but unfortunately due to corona they could not replace it as their service centers were closed. I've sent them almost 7-8 mails which were not replied and many calls which were not answered and if somehow they answered 1-2 calls they didn't solved my problem. Now it has already been 3 months and everything is normal after lockdown still my headphones are stuck with them. Finally I have lost hope from this useless company and their incompetent service and I am looking for some genuine brands this time.]\\n\", '\\n  Ive been regularly purchasing boat earphones products since a long time. From wired to wireless and this was my first wireless earphone. Sound quality is good but the problem is, it didnt lasted more than a year and left bud just died. It usually happens boat products lasts around a year or so, but this one lasting 8 months was a surprising.Read warranty information, and this should be covered in warranty. Created a ticket on their support website. Received ticket number and email mentioning the pickup process proving the return shipment details and the waybill number. Problem is, it never got pickup up since a week. Here is the ordeal- You would receive a message for couple of days intimating pickup and executive number. Executive never comes for pickup. When trying to reach on his number, it says incoming is disabled on this number. SMS cannot be sent on this number. Overall you can never reach on this number.- When you email the courier company, you would receive standard email that it will be taken care or responded back within 24 to 48 hours but nobody cares to respond back- When you call the courier company number it never accepts the AWB or your mobile number- When you try to email Boat Support, again standard response to follow support website for complaint. Now, the website has only two options to create complaint or to check status.- When you call boat support, option 1119 will take to customer care execute. I doubt if any real person exists to take your call as it always keeps you on hold for 2 minutes and says all executives busy and we will reach you later and sooner but nobody ever calls.- You just have to follow madly but you cannot reach anyone here.All together, BoAt products sound good at consumer level but lack quality and now I think they are designed that way, not to survive for long, so you keep buying new ones every year. A desi chinese product company. The support is nothing but sham. A product which doesnt build to survive for long enough isnt a good choice, and I would recommend to buy something better with your hard earned money. WIll keep updating further progress if they would care to attend the service request complaint or not.\\n', \"\\n  I love music. In my phone you will find  music ranging from Mozart to Linkin Park. And for the purpose of enjoying my music I have used various earphones (Sony, JBL, Skull Candy, Sennheiser etc.), but this is my first bluetooth earphones (a birthday gift from my wife) and after using it for 4 days, here I am sharing my detailed review...1. Build Quality ~ Very good. It's very lightweight, but doesn't seem to be fragile. (4.5/5)2. Sound Quality ~ Absolutely brilliant. I had seen many YouTube reviewers claiming that the Bass is this overpowers all the tiny sounds, but that's compeletely wrong. (4.5/5)3. Bass + Treble ~ The balance is quite fine, and if your music player has an equalizer you can tweak the balance according to your liking. (4.5/5)4. Comfort ~ These are lightweight as I have already mentioned, so it is a given that they are comfortable, even when using for hours. But personally, I have found that the left ear hook doesn’t fit as comfortably as the right one. You can remove the ear hooks though! (4/5).5. Battery backup ~ For me it has been more than 4.5 hours. (4/5)6. Pairing ~ As easy as it gets. (5/5)7. Noise Cancellation ~ Great. (5/5)I got it for ₹1199 and I can confidently recommend this to you. 🙂\\n\", \"\\n  The bass and sound clearity is just awesome..very comfortable...call quality is also awesome...but the battery seems not ok.I got the product delivered yesterday after unboxing the product I noticed that the battery was 100% I have continuously used it for like 2-3 hours and the battery % came down to 80% again I have used it for like 2hours and the battery was still 80%.Day 2,In the morning I used it again for like 30 minutes suprisingly the battery was still 80% I was just amazed.Later I dint use it till the evening.Later on at 7 I used it continuously till 9 pm and yes the battery was still 80%.Here the real problem occurs after the my dinner I was relaxing in the balcony and was on a phone call suddenly I started getting beep sounds from my new boat 255 earphones and the I checked the battery% it was 20% I was like whaaattttt!! seriously!! Like 5mins before it was still 80% and out of nowhere suddenly it went down to 20% this really pissed me off and within 30 seconds battery down totally dead...horrible.I'll check it again tomorrow if I still the same problem persist I'll have to replace the item between the build quality, sound, call quality is really good.That's all for now amigos.\\n\", '\\n  As the headline tells, its garbage and it ends up where it belongs; the bin. It is just beyond understanding how product like these keep on selling and end up as recommended ones for a buyer.The first ones I received stopped working withing two weeks of usage. So, returned them and received a new one and they stopped working as well within its first month. Sound quality was just average, the effort for the brand it seems is just to make profits and nothing else.Any advice I can give is start making products after trying and proper testing. If you have the numbers for selling to why not make products exciting. I first got boat made products around 2017 and it feels like they have just made their way only down the road over this time.\\n', \"\\n  I have been using this for more than a month now, especially bought for my work from home operation for many calls and meetings but that's where it's a big mistake I have done by purchasing this. This is too worst at noise cancellation. Examples : teammates told many times about too much disturbance from fan sound, even to worst they enquired whether I'm bringing up any CROW as a pet(crownsound is way too far at outside) and it is not showing correct battery level. It showed 80% and trusting this I went to meeting but it got disconnected due to no power. When it comes to music listening, that's in a exact opposite. Perfect bass and clarity even with less volume level also easy to fit and good ergonomics.Pros :1) Sound clarity2) Bass effect3) Easy to connect and well fit4) Design and look wise goodCons :1) Worst at noise cancellation2) Battery percentage not showing correctly3) Too long time to hold for on/off\\n\", \"\\n  It's a good product it's also alert when the Volumn in high or lowBattery backup is excellentCharging time 40 min\\n\", '\\n  It’s just okay.. because it is not meet my expectations, dual connectivity is not stay able and when one phone connection is working (like call ongoing) another connection is disturbing ( disconnect/connected) with connection voice notifications. It is very irritating. Boat needs to solve the problem. Rest is ok like, volume/Bass/battery/noise cancellation etc.If anyone buy for calling purpose,try One plus z neckband. It is amazing dual connectivity, and battery backup is awesome.\\n', \"\\n  Bought this for gifting purpose for a friend. Came ultra damaged first time. The Box was fully crushed. Returned.Got the replacement item, it was again all crushed. Looked like someone has thrown this a 100 times. Thought to give it a try, but the structure of the ear plugs is not good. Specially the extra rubber which is there to hold in place. Within 10 mins, your mind goes from music to 'whats pocking in my ears'.Overall, a bad experience.Built quality : 8/10Sound quality : 7/10 (if you are a Sennheiser user)Battery life : 9/10overall for the price : 8.5/10Edit: Had gifted one to a friend just 2 months back, and its not working on one side now. Raised a warranty claim with BOAT, and they said would replace it with a new one at no extra cost. But, this may take 20-30 days.\\n\", '\\n  A good buy for the 1.3-1.5K price rangs.Pros:1. Bluetooth 5.0 does provide a fast and reliable connectivity2. Noise cancellation is good whil watching movies or listening to songs3. Battery back up is good supported by quick charge. 15mins charge does give u a good 1Hr of continuous playback.4. Lightweight flexible fairly good build quality.5. Fit is comfortabke and secure6. Nice base and good sound clarity. Lyrics and instrumentals are crisp and good.Cons:1. Mic pics up a lot of background noise even if its TV running 20-25ft away at medium volume inside the house. Outdoor havent been able to test due to lockdown.Not the best choice if outdoor calling is the highest priority of purchase2. The earhooks keeps coming off the earbuds and there are no replacements are also provided.Hence if u loose the earhooks its gone forever.Although its not absolutely necessary to use the earphones. Without the earhooks also the fit is fairly secure.3. Simultanious pairing of two devices can sometimes be a pain. But its rare amd only in case of new pairings.\\n', \"\\n  Don't don't  by this product...not charged even after  putting two hrs...not easily get  connected to mobile....poor quality....When I complaint against this issue they collected the product but not update feedback further to me  , and after continuous follow up with them they informed me that, they replaced the same and shared the Blue dart currier details  , I am waiting more that 2 months  still curried not reached to me , when I enquired with Blue dart they informed me that they return the consignment to BoAT why don't know ?.now more than 2 months I am taking continuous follow with them (BoAT) but no reply to my CONTINEOUS email reminders.. Amazon is only interested in selling the product but not help u  out from such problems FROM MANUFACTURES  ...Do not....  By any BoAT  product.....Amazon not warried about this ... simply denay...u won't get any help from Amazon...so.don't by this product..u will get chitted...by Boat as well as Amazon.....third class ... manufacturer and sealer... services...\\n\", \"\\n  This bluetooth headset is a nice one. After almost 1.5 years of usage, it is still doing a great job.The box contained the boAt Rockers and three pairs of ear-tips ranging from small to large size.The battery life is not amazing but it can suffice for a full working day with a lot of calls and streaming internet content. Battery is still in good shape.It shows battery percentage in multiples of 20. For example, after 100%, it will show 80% directly. No issues with that.The bluetooth range is decent. It tends to disconnect when the device it is connected to is say, a room away.The microphone quality is also decent because no one complained about it.It is certainly not the absolute best in terms of audio quality. This department is highly subjective but, a pure, neutral sound cannot be expected because of the emphasized bass which I enjoyed. The mid-tones and the high-tones tend to get muffled a little bit but then, that's what we must expect from any earphone that has added bass to it. It is definitely enjoyable.There exists latency but it's negligible. One might not notice it unless exclusive attention is paid to the same.If you want that added bass and neutral sound isn't your cup of tea, you can check it out!Noise cancellation doesn't make a major difference because the ear-tips are in-ear style.However, it has a micro-USB port that it uses to charge.However, with the likes of Realme Wireless Buds, OnePlus Z and Oppo Enco in the market, this is not the best buy but it's still a good buy if you're very tight on budget. But 1.5 years ago, it was definitely a great buy.Cheers!\\n\", \"\\n  I have used the product for more than 4 months... and just started feel like I'm using it for few hours..this is my impression..first I'm a Boat head..and has been using themvfor the last couple of years..I have discarded my earlier JBLand Philips head phones long back...I'm extremely impressed by boAt 225 edition...just awesome and I am comparing this 255 Bluetooth to the 225..First Bluetooth connectivity is very good and easily covers 10 feet...build is ok but needs a good look...second sound quality may not be like the wired ones (I am slightly disappointed)..voice clarity using microphone is good ( little disappointed) noise cancellation is better compared to 225... finally battery quality is good ..will surely run for 7-9 hours depending on use...bass quality is good..not better than 225..HD sound is impressive..For other Boat heads..if I am wrong let me knowSound quality-3.5/5Build quality-3.5/5Bluetooth connectivity-4/5Noise cancellation-3/5Over all 3.5/5..Boat please improve the quality..for new buyers it's satisfactory but not overwhelming at this price..good luck\\n\", '\\n  I got it during Independence sell @999 (excluding 199 rs. Discount.I m waiting this review after 3 weeks of use.Sound volume: I m using realme mobile and I feel that sound volume is little bit low.Sound quality: It depends on device. When I use it with my PC, sound is ossm. Also it give good bass in mobile.Looks and materials: definitely it is good and longevity is high. But it could better if available neck band as boult provide. Other issue is that there is no vibration,so sometimes you will miss the call when earpiece is not in ear.Battery life: charging time is 2 hour approximately. After fully charge, you can enjoy 5:30 hours battery backup.All over no any other issue till now.If your budget is around 999 rs, you can definitely go with it...\\n', '\\n  Good Bluetooth in the ear headphones....Sound quality is decent....may seem a little thin, takes time to get used to, but definitely not bad or poor.Battery life too is decent( around 5-6 hrs) when connected.Build quality is good, though you need to b a little careful.All in all a VALUE FOR MONEY deal ( especially sweet since I got it at an attractive deal price of INR 999 during the Great Indian Amazon Sale).\\n', \"\\n  I brought this earphones and now I'm writing the review with experience using it (I'm a light user not a heavy user).Battery backup lasts Max 3 hrs 😭 since the time I bought, the microphone is very very bad, you might sound very low or like talking from a long distance 😓.I brought this on Jan 2020. This was billed for 1399 that time.Product quality is acceptable, but the price will be too much when comparing the battery backup, microphone quality and the bigger size button/cable.\\n\", '\\n  Great and comfortable headset. Had no issues in pairing with 2 devices simultaneously. Decent sound quality with high on Bass. Good value for the money.  Have been using during work out and looks like it is really sweat and water proof as advertised.When switched on and connected, the voice that announces is very silly.. \"you are connect to nirvana\" what????? and also when you disconnect or power off .. it says \"adios amiego\".. why an Indian company chose this announcement is beyond me. Wish they had it very simple and plain .. like good bye...Overall a very good headset for the price..\\n', '\\n  I bought this boAt rockerz 255 on my friends suggestion, hez using these for a quit while now say months...

This phone is no doubt very much good.\\n', \"\\n  Hi all,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.I would give  you my honest experience..I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.6.sound is average,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound)Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.Thanks 👍\\n\", '\\n  Beauty and the beast combination with snapdragon......\\n', \"\\n  Don't go for this mobile as I face issue with network signal after 2days only and I tried call to customer care of amazone they said me it's issue with your sim card but as I ask my sim card customer care they said it's new updated sim card and and i have issue with both sim card which has different network then how both sim has issue in same time, every time costomer care give me some reason to do this that but yes in my mobile I feel it has some issue because of that it's network gone for more than hour and also it hang in between gaming and use as it has 6gb ram and good processor.\\n\", '\\n  Poor camera quality. Breadth too wide to grip well\\n', \"\\n  The phone looks very good and premium but I noticed it lags and camera isnt that good..m facing hardware issues as well..on call the other person can't hear my voice .\\n\", '\\n  Camera Protrait mode Not good but 48 MP cam GoodScreen protector pre-applied very bad quality (patch on screen )Interstellar black colour awsmeTouch also not good (Need Amoled Disply)Refresh Rate Very Low around upto 30 HZSide Mounted Fingerprint Sensor Really Faster18W fast charger - 47% to 100 % Battary Charge Time 1 Hr 21 MINWaste of money\\n', '\\n  Super camera, battery, sound amazing  very much\\n', \"\\n  I'm not satisfied with this mobile bcs internet speed was very slow.. Before this phone i use samsung galaxy Note 5..comparing to samsung note 5 I feel speed of the internet was slow in this phone and another prblm i found in this phone was wireless headphones was disconnect automatically...\\n\", '\\n  Redmi note 6 pro is much better option as compare to this phone.Battery is goodLookwise ok.Charger getting heat within 20 to 30 min. Charging is also slow.Camera is also not so good as mentioned.Overall 3 points out of 5.Not a good option to purchase so wait for redmi note pro max.....\\n', '\\n  Even when you are holding it in your hand, fingers keep touching scanner every now and then. Scanner placement is very wrong. Otherwise phone is good.\\n', \"\\n  Got the Note 9 Pro in Galcier White Colour on first sale itself. I skipped Note 8 Pro. Swift Delivery with Amazon. After spending a few weeks with it, here's my experience. I keep switching phones often and let's see if Note 9 Pro is the ideal phone.Design:Awesome design. I like the center placed punch hole camera, it gives a overall sense of symmetry. The Aura Balanced Design is premium. Glass Front & Back With Curved Edges. Plastic Frame. Phone comes with a silicon back cover in the box and a plastic screen guard pre applied on the screen. Looks really nice with the white colour but due to 20:9 aspect ratio and large screen, it is a tall phone, quite difficult to handle single handedly even with my big enough hands. Also I now need to buy jeans with bigger pockets because in my wardrobe I couldn't find a jeans that could accommodate this phone comfortably. Although It is a nice premium looking design but not practical due to being tall which hinders one handed usage. Also the camera bump is protruding a few millimetres but Xiaomi claims that the Camera module is also coated with Gorilla Glass 5 Protection so it should be scratch resistant to some extent.Display:Screen being an IPS LCD Full HD+ Panel is large at 6.67 inches with 20:9 aspect ratio, is tall and not too wide. Bezels around are very slim and the chin is minimal. Screen to body ratio is impressive. It's certainly big or tall in vertical terms. Quality wise the screen is good, brightness is satisfactory for indoor and outdoor usage but the screen is not as vivid or lively as AMOLED screens. Viewing angles are good. Little bit colourshifting can be noticed when viewing from different angles. No higher refresh rate though which everyone kinda expected. Touch response is good, not too fast or too slow even when playing PUBG. Brightness could've been more for better outdoor visibility under direct sunlight. Reading mode is there to filter harmful bluelight. Overall, display quality is good and satisfactory.Sound Output:Sound quality is clear and loud through the speaker, thought lacking on bass and instruments. Call quality is loud and clear as well. Earphone output is little disappointing. I have premium sounding earphones which sounded better on my previous phone but the sound output via the 3.5mm jack is quite low on the Redmi Note 9 Pro so you've to crank up the volume and let's not talk about the richness of the sound which is completely lacking. While playing PUBG Mobile with Earphone plugged in, I could barely hear the footsteps in the game and had to crank up the volume to max. Everyone should report this earphone sound quality issue to Xiaomi. Update: Low Volume Level in earphones has been fixed after OTA update but the richness in audio is still lacking.Performance:Performance is fine even on the 4 GB 64 GB Variant. Didn't see any lag or shutter while performing normal day to day tasks, thanks to Snapdragon 720G Chipset built on a power efficient 8nm Process. Now the big question, can it handle PUBG?Yes, you can play PUBG Mobile with Smooth & Ultra (40 fps) Combination and HD & High Maximum but the game is not properly optimized as it is a new chipset. I played PUBG for 2 straight weeks on Smooth and Ultra Graphic settings and noticed the game freezing in classic and other modes for a few seconds in almost every match.. Earlier I used to play PUBG in Smooth & Extreme (60fps) option on my previous phone so playing in Ultra (40fps) on Note 9 Pro feels little downgrade. Gameplay was smooth for most of the part but frame freezes quite frequently which made the gameplay not so enjoyable. Didn't notice any heating issues. Temp was mostly under control. Another problem I encountered with PUBG is the low sound output from the earphone (Ant Audio W56 or any other) plugged in. Xiaomi should rectify this issue ASAP!Update: Low Volume Level in earphones has been fixed after OTA update.Cameras:Talking about the camera quality, I am not impressed with the Note 9 Pro. The quality is average, default 12 MP shots from the main camera lack details when zoomed in and look oversharpened along with a warm colour tone and noise and other post processing artefacts quite visible even in good lighting conditions. HDR is a hit or miss most of the time. There's a new option in the camera app to boost colours similar to Chroma Boost feature found in Realme Smartphones. 48 MP shots look a little better especially in terms of details in comparison to default 12 MP Shots. Front camera quality is average as well. To be honest, I'm little disappointed with the camera output but it's not a major issue as I have a Nokia 808 PureView as my go to Camera Phone since 2014. You could install GCam Mod for better quality output as Camera 2 API is supported out of the box.Connectivity:Had no issues with WiFi or Bluetooth. It has support for NavIC, India's own satelite for navigation. No issues with location services.Though didn't notice a faster location locking using NavIC. Cellularr Network Strength I found is little low in my experience, because the same SIM Cards inserted in my other phone used to provide better network reception, as a result, the download speeds are somewhat lower on Note 9 Pro. Will test further and update here.Battery is rated at 5020 mAh and Xiaomi is providing 18W Charger in the box. If we remember a year ago, 18W was considered fast but this time it has a larger capacity battery than previous Note series smartphones. A full charge normally takes more than 2 hours which is not bad for a 5000 mAh battery. Everyone this time expected Xiaomi to provide a charger rated at 22W or more. The global variant ships with a 22W Charger. Why Xiaomi? Battery can get you more than a day depending on your usage so it shouldn't be a problem. It's good for long gaming sessions as well.Some really important features worth mentioning:It has 2 SIM Card Slots with a dedicated MicroSD Slot so it's a good decision on part of Redmi/Xiaomi. The charging port is Type C which I appreciate. Fingerprint Sensor is mounted on the Side Power Button and it's fast to unlock the phone. You have the option to choose whether to press the power button or just touch on it to unlock the phone. IR Blaster is another nifty feature to control various electronic appliances. It works well with my Set Top Box so no need of reaching the remote everytime I want to switch channels or lower the volume. Fortunately there is a notification LED next to the earpiece, though you only get a single white colour. Still I consider the notification LED as an essential feature.OS:It's running MIUI 11 on top of Android 10. I liked MIUI during Redmi Note 3 times when it was a clean UI and had no Ads or content recommendations feature inbuilt. Still It's packed with features and offers a lot of customization though the amount of bloatware is ridiculous. Thankfully almost all of them can be uninstalled which I recommend. Content recommendations and ads can be partially turned off. Just don't like that there's no option to uninstall the Mi Browser.So to sum it up, I would say it's a good phone for the price except for a few things.Pros:Premium Design.CGG 5 Protection Both Sides.Nice Display Quality.Good Sound Via Loudspeaker.IR Blaster.Good Performance.Less Heating.Very Good Battery Backup.Cons:Quite Tall So One Handed Usage Is An Issue.Protruding Camera Module.No 90 Hz Refresh Rate.Average CamerasPUBG Mobile Not OptimizedNetwork Reception & Download Speeds Should Be Improved.\\n\", '\\n  \\xa0As you can see in the video that there is no headphone connected to the device ... No sound is emitted through the device. Poor flaw in the manufacturing sector. I would have rather rated 0 if it the option was present.\\n', '\\n  Fingerprint reader is working with quick actionBattery life is also good but it takes more time to chargeCamera quality is also good and front camera is not satisfying meGood mobile for playing pubg with her graphics\\n', \"\\n  Bought Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black) in 1st sale, using it extensively. Read my review, if you are planning to buy one.EDIT: 1. Updating review for using more than a month, facing some strange battery drain issue, battery is not lasting even for a day. Once, fully charged, it automatically gets decreased by 5-10% without doing anything.2. For daily usage screen size feels too big, not easily manageable, also device is bulky.--------------------------------Pros:1.  48MP Quad Camera (with Samsung GM2 Sensor) captures amazing pictures, both outdoor as well as indoor.- Even in low light conditions, photo looks cool.- Selfie looks more natural, not over beautification like oppo,vivo.2.  6.67 inch FHD+ dot display looks good.3.  Dedicated Memory card slot.4.  5020 mAH li-polymer battery - it easily lasts for more than a day with average usage.- With 18w charger, it takes less than 2 hrs for full charge.5.  P2i splash-proof nano-coating6.  Notification LED7.  IR Blaster*NavIC for navigation, but haven't noticed any difference than GPS.Cons:1.  60 Hz display (vs 90 Hz display of Realme 6) : Difference is noticable, while playing games.2.  For PUBG, RN9Pro frame rate setting limited to Ultra, on other hand, Realme6 supports up to Extreme.In short, Gaming is better on Realme 6 with MediaTek G90T.Final Verdict: If you want device with better battery performance, Redmi Note 9 Pro is gold choice.- For better display & gaming experience, get Realme 6.*Will edit review, after using few more days.\\n\", '\\n  The phone is not supporting any kind of SD card and always asking to format the SD card.

Takes very long for full charge, 4-5 hours4. I have faced glitches while playing games, like sound stops or decreases on its own5. Camera stops and needs phone restartSo i would suggest to buy some other phone as it is not good for gaming\\n', \"\\n  I've bought Redmi note 9 pro on the 1st sale. I've been having issues like 'voice disappearing during call', i. E.  The other person is unable to hear me after 1-2 min into the call , especially in primary sim slot. I've already submitted the issue as feedback.Also, let me know if anyone else is facing the same problem.Amazon is not accepting replacement. Buy this phone at your own peril\\n\", \"\\n  Awesome phone with nominal rate.Pros: 1. Good features and battery.2. Good for gaming(pubg)3. Android 10 is smooth.4. Fingerprint is located in comfort position. Fingerprint sensor response is really good.5. Huge display.Cons:1.bloatware apps.2. Battery lightly heats up when charging. (Quick charge 18w is reason I guess) if you remove backcase. Then it may cool down.3. Bit heavy 208 g. (While playing game I can feel it)If you manage cons then it's really premium phone to buy.I was iphone6s user. When I thought it won't match to iphone. But the phone doesn't disappoint me. I really happy with my purchase. It is also come with pre applied screen protector and transparent case. I never liked redmi UI earlier. Now Xiaomi really improved all features. Phone looks premium model. About performance it's not at all lagging.I bought 6 gb ram and 128 gb internal variant.Overall its worth every penny.Go for it.\\n\", \"\\n  Please don't buy camera is not working properly\\n\", \"\\n  Worst I have have seen till now. Don't even think of buying this kind of mobile. Not even 1 month completed the purchase of this mobile.

But very happy to purchase this phone\\n', '\\n  The phone Restarts automatically if you call more than 15 mins.\\n', '\\n  \\xa0Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectations from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in the last 2 years but this one is truly beast in terms of Performance, built quality & Camera.Sharing detailed review post spending a 3 days with the phone as my primary device.⚫ Display: 4.5/5 (Quality Stuff)6.67 Inch FHD+LCD Display with Multi-touch capacitive touchscreen which is an added advantage in intense gameplay like Pubg to dominate enemies like in TDM. 2.5D Curve glass adds elegance to the look.⚫ Build quality: 5/5 (Sturdy)It looks like an ultimate beast and powered with splash-proof design & 3D Corning Gorilla Glass 5. That secures your smartphone even after falling from 4 fts.⚫ Camera: 5/5 (Absolue clarity)48MP Quad rear camera with ultra wide mode. portait mode work extremly well in edge detection & bluring giving it a natural look. 5MP Macro camera will help in close & detailed photos which i tried with flowers most of the times :p but it does the job! Night mode is kind of okay only.⚫ Battery: 4/5 (Big Battery with Average charging speed5,020 mAh Battery with 18W Charger it could be better if it would have 20W Charger as it would have decrease charging time which almost take 140minutes to charge from scratch.⚫ Screen size: 4/5 (Big in Size but with total Balance)Giving 91.4% Screen to body ratio which is easy to handle while playing intense gaming. where controls depend upon your phone grip.⚫ Sound: 4/5 (Descent Speaker with Quality output)Sound is good enougSnapdrag\\n', \"\\n  I am disappointed with redmi note 9 pro products. I bought this phone on dated 25 may 2020. Today, 28/05/2020, the screen suddenly stopped working and phone automatically going to off. Voice not clear during the phone call. The phone doesn't get switch on after the screen display went off. This is a ridiculous product brand who only offers reasonable priced phone but quality is so poor and services are worst. I am not able to contact their team. The product is still under warranty. I an suggestion no one purchase this product\\n\", '\\n  I would suggest everyone to buy the product... I have purchased this in first sale at 12999₹ and is overall very satisfied till date at this price point.Pros:1. Massive battery backup2. Camera (Too good)3. Design4. Quich fingerprint scanner5. Top notch quality6. Very responsive and quick7. Pubg and counter strike is very  smooth8. Fells as a premium phoneCons:1. A little heavy due to huge battery2. Slow charging 18 watts (2 hours  approx) full charge3. Display performs a little less in  sunlight4. Little slippery (if used without  cover)Overall if compared to realme 5 pro and realme narzo with redmi note 9 pro it looks very premium and design is very good and wins in every aspect if charging is kept asideRealme only wins in charging capacity which provides 33 watts charger.Hope it helps👍\\n', \"\\n  This phone is fantastic just wow it's as good as I expected , battery is almost 2 days , gaming experience is fantastic , display quality is awesome , best camera at this price , just go for this phone even if the price is 15000, amazing work #mibest\\n\", \"\\n  This phone is worst. It's been only 8 days , the phone is lagging a lot. I have made a new space in phone for my office workplace so on switching it takes around 1 min.Sometimes,it gives a lag when I try to unlock through fingerprint, moreover frequently it restarts.I told this issue to Amazon people they told me to download the app to verify my issues, and they are saying that there no such issues they have report of it and when I asked them ki how much ram is in current usage they were not able to tell me because as I can check ram usage is around 70℅ and I dnt have enough apps in my phone. They have changed all the return policies and their service is worst.\\n\", \"\\n  Good looking phone due to glass panel. After handling won't make it up to the mark as compare the price. The display lacks the response as compared to the same price tag mobiles in the market. Also, Mi claims FHD+ display but looks very outdated screen; It may be because of a low refresh rate. Face recognition for unlocking screen work slightly slower as compared with other brands. The placing of the rear camera looks very premium. But as per the current trade-in market, the company provided 48MP seems very outdated. Over the period, the rear camera will be getting lots of scratches, even if you have the protective cover to the mobile. The mobile comes with Fast charging by 18W, which is very slow as considering the 5000 mAh battery. To charge the mobile completely, it takes ~2hr. As per current trade, Mi should provide a 28W or 30W charger. The company offered Clear soft case, which is very cheap quality and it is not clear. It looks just some very cheap robber soft case. Lastly, the mobile comes with 3.5 jack for headphones, and people always prefer to buy a Bluetooth headset. I feel; instead, a 3.5 jack company should offer the dual speaker.\\n\", \"\\n  I've taken this mobile by seeing product reviews on YouTube. But Device totally different from reviews. Too much heat and hanging. Battery drainage  are the problems O face now. I'm truly unsatisfied with the product. Delivery is ok.\\n\", \"\\n  My Earphones jack was defected. Due to non availability of wired earphones in the market as shops were closed during lockdown i couldn't check it during  the return period of 10 days. And now i am unable to even apply for refund or replacement.  Amazon is not even considering exceptional circumstances. Don't buy it from here since there are defaults that you may discover after 10 days but then you won't be able to apply for return or even replacement. The device i got was actually faulty.. nowadays its camera also won't open sometimes.. I am highly disappointed with Amazon's service.\\n\", \"\\n  I waited 3 months finally got delivery I paid 1200 ...

The screen goes blank after attending any call... seems like i got some defective piece and could not return the same coz of lockdown and still have not been able to show it to any service center, seems like i have wasted my hard earned money...\\n', \"\\n  Don't buy 4GB version bcz too slow and if u use 3 or 4 application mobile stuck and some time restart automatically....Camera picture quality OK but night time not good and camera app response also slow other wise mobile NYC battery backup and big screen all super expect camera responses and software hanging problems\\n\", '\\n  It has both pros and cons.#Coming to pros :1.

Did not expect such a bad product from Redmi . I m a regular user of redmi phone. My earlier redmi note 5 pro is working fine for last two years and no such issue with my earlier phone. Redmi needs to ramp up the quality of their mobiles. seems they are compromising on quality after achieving success on the brand earlier. This is not good. Shame on redmi for fooling customers.\\n', '\\n  Note 9 pro is worst phone launched by MI till now, i bought this phone by trusting MI brand as i have used Redmi note 4 earlier which is a superb phone by MI.But in this Redmi Note 9 pro,  Xiaomi is making fool customers by by just changing the location of finger sensor at a wrong place (sideways).They say that camera is 48 Mp but when you take photos, there is nothing like 48 MP.Touch screen is too slow.Battery is 5020 mha but it is draining too fast. Nothing like 5020mha.Phone is too heavy to handle while you do multiple tasks while using the phone.Just a waste of money.\\n', \"\\n  Redmi Note 9 Pro have the big issues in  Camera & batter1.

A phone that will run with your budget as well as keep up with your requirements.• Design aspect, it's a good build phone, looks and feels premium with a uni-glass body and it also maintains a symmetry in regards to the camera placement, hole punch notch, etc (if you're into that sort of thing).• Yes it's a lil thick in regards to it's width but honestly that doesn't create any issue. I would have that with a lil bigger battery, so no problem.• The display is upto the mark running a hole punch display in the middle, which is less disturbing. The only complain I've is the lack of 90Hz refresh screen, I feel Redmi should've incorporated that given that their rival had that within this budget only.• Camera is average. The 4GB variant has 48MP camera which I feel is okayish, lacks of sharpness. The thing I observed is the difference of colour science between the main common camera and 48MP camera.• The phone packs versatility within a budget in regards to various camera aspects, performance and UI. You can't complain about MI UI 11 (remember to uncheck all the boxes for personal ads, etc. when first booting up the phone)• In regards to performance, I got the 4GB variant because the user don't need a lot high specs, yet I tried all the common games like PUBG, COD, etc. Don't expect PUBG to run with full high graphics, beside that it runs smoothly. Also the phone gets a lil too warm on the upper end while extensive use.• Speakers are adequately loud. Voice calls and all felt perfectly fine. Network connectivity had no issue as well.• The phone packs a humongous battery, so it'll outlast an average user for atleast 2 days. 18W is not that fast, it'll take around 2hrs to charge completely.~ In conclusion, overall it's a great buy within this budget. Remember to note down your requirements before you opt for a phone like this, it's not meant to satisfy if your expectations are high. If you've a lil more budget, go for something else. Other than that, it's worthy phone for daily usage.\\n\", \"\\n  I have been using this product for 3 weeks and it's absolutely worth evey Penny no heating problem while normal usage but heats while playing games like pubg, COD,ect. But it's not major if you play them like above 2 hours heats a little bit like 40 degree , camera is very good, battery performance is very good as well last for 1.5 day easy, no lags at all overall it's best under this price range just go for it.\\n\", '\\n  Design and look is premium. Performance is good ... Games like pubg runs smooth in high graphic. Battery life is very good. 10hours screen on time with moderate usage. 6% drop after watching 1 hour youtube and 10-12% if play pubg .

I was amazed. But soon after I ordered and received the product, I realized that the screen has a gradiant grey shading from the bottom. The glass quality doesn't look like the ones we have in premium phones. I wonder if Corning Gorilla Glass is also made as per grade and different rates. To sum it up you get a considerable product better go for Samsung M21 and thank me later.\\n\", '\\n  Awesome phone....this is the very comfortable phone....price is no very costly..#Milove\\n', '\\n  Battery promise is fake.

Battery takes 2 hours 5 mins approximately to charge fully (checked 3 days in a row)3. It hanged once in a day average (2 times got switched off also) - let's hope this is a software issue and get solved soon.4.

But that's my worst decision. Can you believe a new phone hanging like a 2 year old phone. Icons of home screen disappear suddenly. Camera is just like a 7k priced smartphone. Takes around 3 hours for full charge. Worst product by redmi till now( it's my first and last redmi phone)\\n\", \"\\n  This phone proved to be a disaster buy for me with poor battery backup, heavy to hold, poor battery back, poorest wifi connection ever.... Also it doesn't recognise my security cameras at home as it only takes 5g camera. I previously owned redmi 6 which is a fantastic phone without any of the flaws I mentioned earlier. Very disappointed... Everyday is a challenge with this phone...\\n\", '\\n  This is my second mobile of xiaomi. First is mia1. Redmi note 9 pro battery backup is very powerful. Camera quality outstanding. Gaming is very good like pubg. It is sufficient to manage all need. It is all rounder mobile\\n', \"\\n  Writing this after a three day useTo start with uniqueness, the quad camera setup, NavIC, side mounted fingerprint sensor, haptic feedback, glassy finish all the factors makes the phone pretty cool.Camera - The phone produces very good images using the 3 sensors(depth, macro, wide) according to customisation along with the primary 48mp shooter. The image produced will be highly dependent on factors like light exposure, camera handling, mode selected etc. Video recording is available with EIS & 30 and 60fps. There is an option to record videos with movie scope. Overall 4.2/5NavIC - The ISRO developed positioning system adds more accuracy while navigating. I really liked it and its our country's technology. 5/5Design - The phone is packed with almost all sensors, no issues. The glassy finish, front and back gives the phone a premium look. Comes with Gorila Glass 5 protection in 3 layers. 4.5/5Dedicated external memory slot - no need to buy a 128gb variant fearing the limited storage, can expand storage upto 512gb. 5/5Network reception - i witnessed a commendable hike in download speed, so the NW reception is very good. 5/5MIUI - Yes there were some preinstalled stuff which can be uninstalled easily. About the annoying ads and notifications, they could be disabled with some settings(available on many internet blogs). There where some minute bugs, which i'd expect to be sorted out with the next UI update. 3.8/5Notch - The user can manage how the punch hole cam could appear according to his desire. I dont like to hide it, as it looks good for me. 4/5Processor - RAM - The qualcomm snapdragon 720g with 2.3ghz clock speed makes the phone more reliable and very smooth. The RAM was able to retain the cache of previously opened apps for a noticeable amount of time, so switching between the apps now and then is not an issue the Processor and RAM pulls it off easily. 4.3/5Speaker - earpiece - Both sound outputs are commendable. 4.3/5Type c USB & 3.5mm headphone jack - Type C cable along with 18w charger, charges the phone within 2 hours from 10% to 100% without any heating issues. 33W adapter can obviously charge the device even faster, but it's not provided in the box. 4/5Battery - With a whopping 5020mah battery a moderate user can use the device for more than 1.5days with one time full charging. 5/5Notification light - It was nice to see the notification light available. After stuffing so many sensors they did not forget to add that, appreciate that. 5/5Gaming experience -  I'm not a mobile gamer, so refresh rate is not a concern to me. Still the qualcomm snapdragon 720g processor can easily handle games like PUBG or COD with HDR graphics.I havent faced any kind of heating issues nor lags while using the camera.Overall it's a very good phone, for this price range it is packed with commendable features and no compromise with the sensors.\\n\", \"\\n  I hate this product..phone battery not working properly and heating and I am trying to return this product but this is not returning ,saying to install a amazon checkup app and that app is also not working.

Having mic 🎤 problem after 15days. So don't ever think to buy this phone. Whatever the hardware is when having a mic prob what's the use having all other hardware.\\n\", '\\n  Being an ardent user of MI i am totally disappointed…Speaker quality is absolutely sub standard.. sound is loud but cracks the bass effects… like low standard phones…Screen brightness is comparatively low…Internet speed is low as compared to samsung vivo or realme phones… you can compare with same service provider sim card and same settings… open youtube you can feel the difference…Battery is average… screen on time is about 6.5 to 7 hours… only updates if it can fix… camera and audio quality wise it is inferior than its siblings like mi note 7 pro. Mi 4 has even better audio quality in speakers…\\n', '\\n  1.Mobile goes blank when we attend any call2.some weird message often comes \" don\\'t cover the year phone area\" what ever u do this will slide from bottom very irritating....Very disappointed ☹️3.camera quality is poor\\n', \"\\n  This is perhaps the worst phone from redmi.

Good phone\\n', '\\n  The only thing I like about the phone is the side mounted fingerprint sensor. It\\'s even faster than my Samsung tab s5e.Now comes the bad parts...1. As has been pointed out by other customers, Internet download speed is very slow (never reaches 2Mbps). My 4 years old Lenovo downloads the same file at 4Mbps using the same service provider at the same time.2. I\\'m not much into \"Mobile Photography\" but the picture quality is horrible. It becomes better with camera apps from Play Store(which doesn\\'t give me control over the three other non primary lenses)3. This is my first time using an MI phone and the ads are annoying af. Can\\'t turn them off too.4. The gesture controls are very uncomfortable. They can learn this from samsung.5. I don\\'t know if this has happened to anyone but I actually ordered the black variant but was sent the blue one. It\\'s written as \"Interstellar Black\" on the box but inside was the blue one.Overall, I\\'m disappointed. I gave it to my sister and I\\'ll be buying another phone.\\n', '\\n  Just Amazing...camera, battery, and performance top of the mark...\\n', '\\n  i got faulty prodct...and amazon was not responding to me...\\n', \"\\n  No prblm from.Amazon , they delivered it fast but a very overpriced phone from Xiaomi .The same phone was very cheap few months back then it was gud but now it is just overpriced with OK specs . The display is imp as it gives a premium feel , but this display at this price is POOR. And even if the phone is too costly u wouldn't feel it as it's Xiaomi and nobody will realise it's costly . Many phones cheaper than this are far better than this .please please buy a phone with better Display!! That will help u with everything u do not have to interact with camera all the time.\\n\", '\\n  Do not buy this phone.Screen bleeding issues.Phone keep on hanging\\n', '\\n  Redmi Note 9 Pro Has been Recently Purchased by Me. I am Disappointed by purchasing this smartphone. This phone has very low quality of Performance, This phone hangs number of times. This hangs anytime. I want solution.\\n', \"\\n  ### IN SHORT ###Overall great phone. I had a lot of problems to purchase this one, Amazon’s delivery OTP problem and many other problems due to lockdown. Screen issues got fixed automatically, but there are bugs in camera, music player, volume, UI which I hope will be fixed in future updates.### IN DETAIL ###The phone got very hot on first charge, and after charging it started having screen bleeding(a very clear neon glow like bright line on the edges of the screen when seeing something dark grey) and image retention (screen burn, especially of time and battery bar and navigation buttons) issues. I fixed the image retention by changing the color scheme settings from Default to Cool and Auto.But a few hours later I updated to latest April2020 patch (there was no mention of screen issues in the update) and then both the screen issues were gone. I changed from Cool back to Default, still no problem.The second charge did not heat up the phone. So either the screen problems were caused by overheating from the first charge which went away when the phone cooled down, or the OTA update fixed it.Everything else is great. No major issues so far. Interstellar black looks gorgeous, but with the given black cover it looks almost fully black. I'm not a gamer, but I played PUBG lite and a few other games, and they were fine.### NIGHT MODE PROBLEM ###Normally night mode images on phone's camera app is great, but sometimes it makes the dark areas grey, which looks bad. Gcam doesn't do that, so it's definitely a software bug and probably will be fixed. Gcam takes better but slower and more detailed night images, Phone's camera takes sharper and faster but less detailed night images.BUGS I FOUND:1. Face unlock not working flawlessly because front cam not able to open sometimes2. camera app couldn’t open a few times, fixed after restart or clearing cache3. night camera can be way better with better processing cause gcam takes much better night photos, though gcam takes more time to shoot and process images4. pictures with flash come highly overexposed and washed out, or the photo comes out as if no flash was used, and this only happens with the primary camera, not the wide lens. VERY STRANGE5. sometimes downloading apps from play store gets stuck at ‘waiting’6. sometimes after unlocking, the phone shows only wallpaper and nav buttons, but the home screen appears when I press the home button, not a big deal but still a bug.\\n\", '\\n  The Camera is so bad,That colours were washed out and sky is so white that white balance is so bad. Finally details to be improved in selfie camera.The last thing Pricing they were increasingly prices gradually not gst but their demand makes it do You get 33W fast charger in POCO M2 Pro which was priced at 15000/- I mentioned was because they would(Sorry will increase price after a few weeks finally coming to the point I would suggest to go for the M2 PRO\\n', '\\n  The Note 9 Pro is bigger by a few millimetres and has also grown thicker substantially thicker. It has also grown heavier. The new model packs a 5020mAh battery and that alone increases the weight by some margin. The display on the Redmi Note 9 Pro is a massive one it measures 6.67-inches and is bigger than most of Xiaomi’s premium phones. Overall this phone is good with glossy look #Milove #Noteseries #Miphone #Mibrand #Mifan\\n', '\\n  It is a amazing phone under budget. High quality performance, great user interface , battery , good processor speed and high camera quality. #Mi\\n', '\\n  Feedback after using it for 20 daysPros :Solid, sturdy and robust material.Premium look and feel.Solid battery performance. no matter what you do it will last for a day and a half.Full speed without any lag thanks to Qualcomm Snapdragon 720.MIUI 11 has the best interface ever.Very good cameras especially night mode.Crisp HD Display with a cool dot notchSide mounted fingerprint is awesome.Cons :Is a bit bulky and heavy. With tempered glass and back cover it is almost 250 gramsThe color is not black or grey but is actually blue.No Quick charging.One of the best paisa vasool mobile phones in this segment. Also need to mention mi phones have good resale value compared to other phones.\\n', '\\n  Just paid marketing, nothing special.. Camera quality is very cheap... User Interface is so cheap..

Because with in 7 days after purchase I met the problem with this. I thought it may resolved automatically while updating phone. But  it does happened. The main  problem in this phone that what ever the xiomi promoted in this phone like QUADRA CAMERA is not at all opening. While opening saying that opening in camera is ERROR please Restart.. So many times Restarted eventhough no response. And phone also strucking while using.I request all of you to kindly not to buy this phone.\\n', \"\\n  Writing this review after 7 days of usage.Giving 4 star because of better battery life expectations, and also that MIUI needs to be cleaner (using for the first time. Was a stock android user since long). Other specs of the phone are fine.Delivery Experience - Great by Amazon. Couldn't recieve it quicker with all the lockdown that's in place nationwide. Recieved within 4 days or ordering.Battery life - Average. I am using the phone extensively, with regular music and light apps. Turns out that the battery lasts 1.5 days. I expected more.Camera - Good. You might find pictures getting hazy but I recieved a software update 2 days before (after 4 days of usage), and since then, the picture quality has been good. Picture quality has been good in all camera modes.Display - Good. Better than expected.Fingerprint Sensor - Takes a little time for unlocked screen to appear after you put your finger. Could have been better. No problems with the location of the fingerprint sensor.Heating Issues - No heating issues in phone whatsoever. Charger gets heated after 1 hour of charging or so.Performance - Good overall. No lags experienced.Charging speed - I could charge my phone from 0-100% in around 2 hours 25 minutes.MIUI - A lot of useless apps would be pre-installed. Half of them can't be uninstalled. MI Browser is bad. I would suggest to go to Apps->Default Apps and change few of those. Sliding up from home screen opens up the MI Browser. You can easily disable from settings.Note - Please disable the Dynamic Wallpaper Carousel. It eats up a lot of battery. By default, it's activated.Works well after the above cleanings.\\n\", '\\n  Using this phone for past 2 months, it is not upto the mark as the previous phones were.I already usedredmi note 7Redmi note 5Redmi 4Also Mi A3All were here gud phones without any issue beside some little prosBut Redmi Note 9 pro having many issues1 many times if you want to click photos it is showing \"can\\'t connect to camera\" Then I have to restart this phone2 It is having dedicated memory card slot but some times it is showing my memory card some times not.3 this phone is lagging too much.Over all I am not happy with this\\n', \"\\n  Overall it's goodGood battery backupPoor camera quality (blur images when you zoom)Full charge it take 2 hours andFone is little heavy\\n\", '\\n  Camera quality is not so good as note 8 pro\\n', \"\\n  Ok so, this is a honest review. Plz don't go for the 4gb ram. This phone is probably built for 6gb ram. Coz it's slow. I got the 4gb, actually wrong product color as I ordered black, I got blue. The camera is actually amazing. But the phone is reeeeeeeallly sloooow. After unlocking the apps load so slow it's annoying and really sad that such a good specs phone sucks so much. So I'd say don't go for the 4gb one. And I haven't used the 6gb variant so I donno if it's slow too. But mine is really irritating. Not happy. But the camera is bomb and that I can't deny. Fingerprint reader is also fine, Not as good as realme sensor but it's fine.\\n\", \"\\n  After one month of use-Pros:1. Battery life2. Design/look3. Fingerprint sensor4. Face unlock5. Screen Touch6. Sound quality + Noise CancellationCons:1. Fast changing- not that much good as of other in the same price range2. Camera- camera performance is average3. Gaming- it's not a gaming phone , don't buy if you are a hard core gamer4. In box Charger- the charge comes with this phone is really of poor quality. USB cable carcks at connection point within a month.\\n\", \"\\n  Great device in budget, we should not expect much in 14k. Rest of the things are perfectly working except fingerprint reader which is misbehaving once in a while (Negligible). I hope MI will resolve this with updates.Camera: Works great except in low light(AI is smoothing the image quality while Processin)Battery: It's the USP of the device, working perfectly.Gaming: PubG in balanced Ultra works great if you have a good speed of internet on your device.UI : It's good but not the best, lots of third party apps needs to be uninstall, showing belly dancing videos in preferred results(I don't know why? SMH)Connectivity: Perfect, way better than my Honor 9 lite. Earlier I was getting 28 mbps and now it's 43 mbps on the same wifi. Calls are good too.Conclusion: If you are on budget of 15k max, just go for it. You won't get a better device in that budget.\\n\", '\\n  Very bad phone..

I have to reboot the phone every time at the time of this supposed network error.Headset connectivity error - sometimes the phone doesn't support the earphone.Wifi error - the wifi connectivity doesn't stay for long.ProsIt has fast charging and long battery life.Finger sensor is excellent.Audio quality is decent.Fast processor.\\n\", '\\n  this phone is awesome its come with best mi camera and  very well charging smooth graphic powerful ram lots of storage and unbelievable features in this price range its best other than any brand, this  phone is better than costly phone which is come in 20k -30k price.

The audio Jack portion is little height hence the 3.5mm Jack won't sit properly,  if you have a big pin then go, 2nd the ring given behind will get loose after 1month so it will always disturb when you hole phone.
